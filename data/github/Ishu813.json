      "text": "> Does doing this make sense in context? aria tags are used for assistive technologies - just setting them to undefined is not the solution.\n\nHi @Jacobjeevan,\nThanks for the feedback. You’re right — setting `aria-describedby` to `undefined` directly isn’t the right fix.\n\nUpdated approach:\n- I’ll ensure DialogContent always receives a valid accessible description when required.\n- If no description is provided, I’ll conditionally omit the `aria-describedby` prop altogether instead of setting it to `undefined`.\n- This prevents the warning while keeping accessibility intact.\n\nETA : 1 day"
