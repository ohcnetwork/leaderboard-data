      "text": "@srijan2607 @rithviknishad , Could I work on this issue please?\nMy solution is to enhance the password visibility toggle button with proper ARIA attributes\nWe can modify src/components/ui/input-password.tsx to include:\n- **aria-label:** Describes the buttonâ€™s purpose (Show password / Hide password).\n- **aria-pressed:** Indicates whether the password is currently visible.\n- **title (optional)**: Provides a tooltip for sighted users.\nETA: 2 days"
