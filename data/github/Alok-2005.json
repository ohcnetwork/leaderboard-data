      "text": "@sj11105  Please assign me this issue! ðŸš€ I'd love to work on improving the patient list sorting for better usability. Implementing dynamic sorting will ensure that newly added patients are always in the correct order.\n\nAdditionally, sorting by last name instead of first name could be more effective, as multiple patients may share the same first name. I can also add an option to toggle between first-name and last-name sorting for better flexibility.\n\nExcited to contribute as part of my GSoC 2025 journeyâ€”looking forward to working on this! ðŸ™Œ"
