      "text": "I will like to work on this, @maishivamhoo123 @hrit2773  kindly assign it to me\n\n**Describe your solution clearly**\nMost likely, the select and input have some fixed width CSS properties on them (`width` or `min-width`). I would remove this and replace with a dynamic width that respects the width of the parent element.\n\n**Possible approach**\n- Use calc() just like @hrit2773 has mentioned\n- Use grid/flexbox on the parent and justify the children to stretch (with a max-width)\n\n\n**Expected Timeline**\nEnd date: within 24 hours after I've been assigned"
