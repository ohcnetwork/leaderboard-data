      "text": "Hello @shivankacker @rithviknishad @tellmeY18\n\nI'm Anuska Dasgupta, a 2nd Year B. Tech CSE student with a passion for AI and healthcare technology solutions. \n\nI'm reaching out regarding the GSoC project to develop an IM wrapper for the CARE platform. I have previous experience developing chatbots and participated in and won several hackathons and project expos.\n\nI have decent experience in NLP, AI, and healthcare tech, and my commitment to improving healthcare accessibility makes me particularly excited about this opportunity. I've also worked on Ruhi which is basically a personal and virtual mental health chatbot assistant.\n\nI'd love to discuss, work and learn about this project with the team !!"
