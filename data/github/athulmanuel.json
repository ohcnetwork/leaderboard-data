Usual injection medicines comes as vial (small glass bottle) or ampule ( small glass pellet). It will be of higher concentrations. At time we give it direct and others instances as diluted. \nThe calculation is \nIn a vial or a ampule contains __ ml of X Medicne which has the strength of __ mg \nEg: 1 ampule of Morphine has 1 ml which has a strength of 10 mg \n\nThis __ ml of X Medicne is diluted in __ ml of solvent ( NS/ RL/ Sterile water/ etc.). This will be give as __ ml bolus(single dose) or as infusion @__ ml/hr "
