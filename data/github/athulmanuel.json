      "text": "I think the time display and sorting feature according to the list will be good enough to start off with \r\n\r\nIe: \r\n- A time display in patient card stating the time left for review or time over after missing a review.\r\n\r\n- being able to sort the list according to the review. so that the line list would be showing the missed review first and then the review pending according to the time to next review.\r\n\r\nHope this is clear. later we could do a scoping of how it has to come out with the events module and specific reviews according to task and login types "

      "text": "Hi guys. Didn't get the gist of the query. Is it regarding the dilution rate? \n\nRegarding giving a medicine diluted in a solvent. Usual injection medicines comes as vial (small glass bottle) or ampule ( small glass pellet). It will be of higher concentrations. At time we give it direct and others instances as diluted. \nThe calculation is \nIn a vial or a ampule contains __ ml of X Medicne which has the strength of __ mg \nEg: 1 ampule of Morphine has 1 ml which has a strength of 10 mg \n\nThis __ ml of X Medicne is diluted in __ ml of solvent ( NS/ RL/ Sterile water/ etc.). This will be give as __ ml bolus(single dose) or as infusion @__ ml/hr "
