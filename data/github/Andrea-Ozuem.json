      "text": "Hi @nihal467, \n\nI'm an aspiring GSoC 2025 contributor and I'm interested in CARE HR Management Module. However, I have a question. The HR Management Module involves both frontend and backend features. Must an interested applicant be able to handle all requirements specified for both the frontend & backend requirements or an interested applicant can propose to contribute to just the frontend requirements?\n\nI'm looking forward to your response!"
