    "title": "Should we move over to react-query?",
    "text": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/react-query\r\n\r\nReact Query is a powerful package for managing APIs with type safety, caching, infinite queries, and inbuilt state management.\r\nIt is almost the standard for managing APIs in react.\r\n\r\n## Why to move\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons are developer experience, and ease of maintenance. Lets take an example using the current request component in our codebase\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nconst [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)\r\nconst [errors, setErrors] = useState([])\r\nconst [data, setData] = useState();\r\n\r\nconst query = useQuery(\r\n   route,\r\n   ...\r\n)\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => setData(query.data), [query.data]);\r\n\r\nconst handleUpdate = async () => {\r\n  setLoading(true);\r\n  const req = await request(...., data);\r\n  if (req.ok) {\r\n    notify(\"Ok\")\r\n    query.refetch()\r\n  } else {\r\n    notify(\"Error\")\r\n    setErrors(req.data)\r\n  }\r\n  setLoading(false);\r\n}\r\n\r\n{loading && \"Form is submitting\"}\r\n{errors && \"Form has errors\"}\r\n\r\n... make a form for our data\r\n<button onClick={handleUpdate}>\r\nsave\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis includes states like loading and error that is very cumbersome to write and maintain.\r\nHere is the same thing with react-query\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nconst [data, setData] = useState();\r\nuseEffect(() => setData(query.data), [query.data]);\r\n\r\nconst query = useQuery({\r\n  queryKey: [\"myquery\", \"type\"],\r\n  queryFn: ...\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst mutation = useMutation({\r\n  mutationFn: () => ....,\r\n  onSuccess: () => query.refetch();\r\n})\r\n\r\n{mutation.isPending && \"Form is submitting\"}\r\n{mutation.errors && \"Form has errors\"}\r\n\r\n...form\r\n\r\n<button onClick={() => mutation.mutate(data)}>\r\nsave\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWay easier to maintain and check for statuses.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of such usecases that will reduce the complexity of our codebase significantly. The less state management the better.\r\n\r\n## Pros of migrating\r\n\r\n- better DX\r\n- easier for new contributors to understand the codebase as most have prior experience with reactquery\r\n- Typesafe\r\n- we wont have to maintain our own hooks\r\n- easier to make infinite queries\r\n- has inbuilt context, so you can interact with a query from a child component without passing down props.\r\n\r\n## cons\r\n\r\n- Too much refactoring\r\n- another dependency package.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, it makes sense for us to switch over, and gradually deprecate the old hooks.\r\n\r\ncc. @bodhish \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "Hey team,\r\n\r\nI have an idea for a new feature we could add to the CARE app ‚Äî a Medical Terminology Explainer. The goal is to help users (especially patients or their caregivers) understand complex medical terms more easily. The idea is to let them input any medical term and get back a simple, clear explanation using the Gemini API.\r\n\r\nHere‚Äôs what I‚Äôm planning to do:\r\n\r\nCreate a new React + TypeScript component (MedicalTermExplainer.tsx) with:\r\n\r\nAn input field for the term\r\n\r\nA button to trigger the API call\r\n\r\nA display section for the explanation\r\n\r\nProper loading and error states\r\n\r\nClean, responsive UI using Tailwind\r\n\r\nAccessibility in mind with ARIA tags\r\n\r\nUpdate index.tsx, index.html, and index.css to support and include this new component\r\n\r\nAdd metadata for the new feature in metadata.json\r\n\r\nIntegrate Gemini (v2.5-flash-preview-04-17) with a simple prompt aimed at generating patient-friendly language\r\n\r\nFix any necessary TypeScript issues (like import.meta.env and ESM imports in Cypress config)\r\n\r\nI believe this feature could add real value, especially in terms of improving health literacy. Let me know if it‚Äôs okay for me to go ahead with this. Happy to hear any suggestions or concerns before starting.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNavaneeth\r\n\r\n",
