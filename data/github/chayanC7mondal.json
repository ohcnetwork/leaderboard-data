      "text": "HEYY\n I'd like to work on this issue.\n\n To fix the UI problem on mobile, I plan to:\n\n- Stack the Question, Operator, and Answer fields vertically on smaller screens\n- Add proper spacing between them so it's easier to type and read\n- Make sure everything still looks good on desktop view too\n\nETA: I can finish this in 1â€“2 days. \nPlease assign this to me so I can get started. Thanks!\n\nscreenshot (with the problem) : \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6778d6b-d592-468b-98b3-e97e3e255c76)"

      "text": " My Solution:\n\n\n- Move the **Filter button** next to the Search bar for easier access and better layout on all screens.\n- Replace the **small filter icon** with a clear button showing both icon and label for better visibility and usability.\n- On smaller screens, simplify the **Refresh button** to just the icon with a subtle spin animation on click, saving space while showing activity.\n- **Group all action buttons** (Refresh, Generate Report, Add Files) in a responsive container that stacks or wraps neatly on small screens.\n- Maintain **consistent styling** (padding, border-radius, hover) across all buttons for a unified look.\n\n\nETA(if assigned) :\n\n- Start: Immediately\n- Complete: Within 1 day\n\nRestructure layout and button grouping for responsiveness\n\nAdd animations and polish specifically for small screens\n\n"
