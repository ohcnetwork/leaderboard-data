      "text": " My Solution:\n\n\n- Move the **Filter button** next to the Search bar for easier access and better layout on all screens.\n- Replace the **small filter icon** with a clear button showing both icon and label for better visibility and usability.\n- On smaller screens, simplify the **Refresh button** to just the icon with a subtle spin animation on click, saving space while showing activity.\n- **Group all action buttons** (Refresh, Generate Report, Add Files) in a responsive container that stacks or wraps neatly on small screens.\n- Maintain **consistent styling** (padding, border-radius, hover) across all buttons for a unified look.\n\n\nETA(if assigned) :\n\n- Start: Immediately\n- Complete: Within 1 day\n\nRestructure layout and button grouping for responsiveness\n\nAdd animations and polish specifically for small screens\n\n"
