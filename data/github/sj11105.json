I have great experience working with react js, next js by making multiple projects both personal as well as for several hackathons including national level hackathon . I have worked on a similar project where patient's data  is recorded , their meal plan is recorded and tracked . The food reaches to their bed numbers by various delivery partners whose information is also stored. \nI can also include feature like notification sending whenever patient needs something or inventory gets empty and on the timings of their meal.\nI am looking forward to make a user friendly , interactive website with best user experience .\nLooking forward to collaborate and make things happen .\nThankyou\n"
