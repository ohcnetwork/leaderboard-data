      "text": "Hi @tellmeY18, @mathew-alex, and @shivankacker,\n\nIâ€™m really excited about the Copilot App Plugin project and would love to contribute! The idea of integrating a floating chat assistant for generating reports, summarizing treatments, and addressing patient queries aligns with my interest in enhancing user experience with AI-powered assistance.\n\nI have hands-on experience with ReactJS, NodeJS, and TypeScript, and Iâ€™ve worked on frontend UI/UX improvements, API integrations, and secure data handling. My recent projects include implementing interactive chat interfaces, real-time data synchronization, and secure authentication mechanisms.\n\nIâ€™d love to start by contributing to the floating action button (FAB) and chat interface, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. Looking forward to collaborating with the team and making an impact! ðŸš€\n\nBest,\nYash Saraswat\n"

      "text": "Hi @khavinshankar, @nihal467, and @Jacobjeevan,\n\nI'm really excited about the Integrate UHI as a Plug project and would love to contribute! The concept of integrating UHI APIs to create a seamless healthcare service experience aligns with my interest in building scalable and efficient solutions.\n\nI have hands-on experience with ReactJS, NodeJS, TypeScript, and API integrations, and Iâ€™ve worked on projects involving payment gateway integration, authentication, and data synchronization. My recent work includes integrating Razorpay for payments, implementing modular plug interfaces, and ensuring seamless backend-frontend communication.\n\nI'm particularly interested in contributing to UHI API integration, service discovery workflows, and the plug interface design. I'd love to start by understanding UHI protocols and exploring how they can be efficiently integrated into CARE.\n\nLooking forward to collaborating with the team and making an impact on this project! ðŸš€\n\nBest,\nYash Saraswat"

      "text": "Hi @nihal467 and @bodhisha,\n\nIâ€™m excited about the Nutrition Rehabilitation module and would love to contribute to its development! The idea of integrating personalized rehabilitation plans, progress tracking, and real-time dietary adjustments aligns well with my interests in building impactful healthcare solutions.\n\nI have experience working with ReactJS, NodeJS, and TypeScript in full-stack projects, and Iâ€™m eager to expand my knowledge by contributing to the Django backend as well. My recent work includes implementing authentication, dynamic dashboards, and payment integrations in React-Node applications. I also focus on writing clean, modular, and well-documented code while ensuring seamless integration with existing systems.\n\nIâ€™d love to start by familiarizing myself with CAREâ€™s existing nutrition modules and contributing to the rehabilitation workflow design and UI/UX prototypes. Let me know how I can get started!\n\nLooking forward to collaborating with the team. ðŸš€\n\nBest,\nYash Saraswat"
