There is no Twitter_Url in the .env file, and you mentioned that if the link is not present, I should make it optional and not render the page. Additionally, there is no Twitter icon in the footer section, so I added a Twitter icon that does not render anywhere, as per your earlier instructions.\r\n\r\nCould you please explain the problem in more detail so I can better understand it? I did my best to resolve the issue based on my understanding, but if you could clarify the feature you're requesting, it would greatly help me to address the issue correctly."
