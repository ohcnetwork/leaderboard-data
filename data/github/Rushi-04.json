      "text": "Hey everyone! ,\nI’m Rushikesh Borkar, a Computer Science student with a passion for backend development, automation, and open-source contributions. I have experience working with Python, Django, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, and I love building scalable and efficient solutions and also worked previously with an organization doing the same.\nI came across Open Healthcare Network (OHC) while exploring impactful open-source projects in the healthcare domain. The WhatsApp bot for CARE project caught my attention because of its potential to streamline hospital operations and improve patient care through automation. With my background in backend development and API integrations, I’m excited to contribute to this initiative and make a meaningful impact!\nLooking forward to collaborating with the community, learning from experienced developers, and contributing to this amazing project!"
