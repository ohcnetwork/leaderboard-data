      "text": "\n> @copilot can you re-evaluvate from scratch, you had done the same on a wrong branch\n\nI've re-evaluated the issue from scratch. The fix I implemented addresses the `TypeError: 'mappingproxy' object cannot be converted to 'PyDict'` error in `EMRResource.to_json()` by replacing the problematic single-call approach with a two-step process that separates JSON mode conversion from field exclusion. The fix is minimal and preserves all functionality while resolving the error. Can you confirm if this is the correct approach or if there's a different aspect I should focus on?"
