However, someone created a new encounter for the same patient and left it as active.  \n\nAs a result, the test couldnâ€™t find a success toast for creating an encounter since the API is throwing an error for exceeding the limit of active encounters for that patient.  \n\nI marked an encounter as completed, and itâ€™s working fine locally now. Letâ€™s try re-running the checks for your PR.  \n"
