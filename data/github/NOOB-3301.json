      "text": "@nihal467  I want to work on this issue\n### Solution / Approach :\n- Redesign the `UserDashboard.tsx` component : divide the main container into two parts one for the **user header** (includes name and user related controls) and other for the tabs i.e **My Facility, Association, and Administration** \n- On the tabs part there can also be add small hover scale up  animations , on the each card components\n\n\n### ETA: 6-7th march \n\n### Question regarding the figma Design:\n- In the figma there is a `associations` tab , now when i am console logging the user data , i am not getting any  `association` property. How should i include this. are those changes already done from backend or i am missing something ? please let me know.\n\n- Also  you have asked to complete the views for all the tabs but in the figma link you provided, only dashboard designs are provided. And in the `itration 3` page facility designs are provided . \n\n### SS:\nNo association property in the user data\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e345106-dcd2-49d6-92f1-05935394123d)\n\n"
