      "text": "Hello **@rithviknishad**,  I want to work on this issue assign me\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\nTo enhance the user experience and make the month/year button in the date picker feel more interactive, I propose the following improvements:\n\n- Implement a hover effect, including a pointer cursor, background color change, and subtle animation.\n\n- Improve focus styles to enhance accessibility and keyboard navigation.\n\nOptionally, add a ripple or highlight effect to provide better visual feedback when clicking.\n\n**Expected Timeline:**\nI anticipate completing the implementation and submitting a Pull Request by Tomorrow.\n\n**Additional Context:**\nI will ensure that the design aligns with the existing UI components and follows accessibility best practices. Please let me know if there are any specific design guidelines or constraints I should consider before proceeding."
