      "text": "@rithviknishad \r\n\r\nThanks for reviewing my PR.\r\n\r\nI will create a new file named `ConsultationFormTranslation.json`. For now, I will only map `consultation_notes` to its relevant display text. In the future, if the display text of other keys needs to changed, they will be added and mapped to their corresponding display texts in this file. Sounds good?"

This is information about types and number of beds in a location: \r\n![main](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62eb72c9-8c7c-4702-b1a6-c4cae7560240)\r\n\r\nDo you want the above information to be shown on the outlined FacilityCard on this page?\r\n![WhatsApp Image 2024-07-15 at 1 25 28 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/998fe92b-9dcf-466e-91fc-ce1cc8b0dbf8)\r\n\r\n2.
