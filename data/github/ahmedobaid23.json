      "text": "I want to clarify a few things regarding this issue.\r\n\r\n1. This is information about types and number of beds in a location: \r\n![main](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62eb72c9-8c7c-4702-b1a6-c4cae7560240)\r\n\r\nDo you want the above information to be shown on the outlined FacilityCard on this page?\r\n![WhatsApp Image 2024-07-15 at 1 25 28 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/998fe92b-9dcf-466e-91fc-ce1cc8b0dbf8)\r\n\r\n2. Do you have any design preferences? Because accommodating all the information into the small FacilityCard will change the design alot!"
