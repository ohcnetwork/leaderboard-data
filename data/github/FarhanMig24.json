I found this issue today morning and thought that it hasn't been handled yet after I synced my local repo with the current one. I thought that the merge request wasn't solving the problem.\r\n\r\nI wasn't aware of the fact that I shouldn't put any pull request if someone is assigned to it.\r\n\r\nI am extremely sorry for that.\r\n@rithviknishad "
