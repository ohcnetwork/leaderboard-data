      "text": "Hi @Spandan-Mishra, @rithviknishad and @Jacobjeevanüëã\n\nI'd like to take this up.\n\nApproach: I‚Äôll ensure that when a new encounter detail view is opened, the scroll position resets to the top‚Äîeither by calling window.scrollTo({ top: 0 }) in a useEffect on mount or by resetting the scroll on the container if it's a modal or drawer. This will align the behavior with expected UX standards.\n\nPlease assign this issue to me so I can begin working on it.\nEOD:1 day\n\nThanks!"

      "text": "Thanks for the reminder! @Tanuj1718. I‚Äôve reviewed the referenced comments and the relevant parts of the repo.\n\nHere‚Äôs my updated approach:\n\n- Display the full Notes content using a multi-line layout instead of a tooltip, as tooltips aren‚Äôt ideal for mobile and shouldn't be the only way to access information.\n- Disable the Update button when there are no changes in the service record by tracking form state or comparing current vs initial values.\n- Disable the Save button when the Description field is empty using basic validation logic.\n\nPlease assign this issue to me. Looking forward to working on it!\n\nETA: 1 day after assigning.\n"

Is there a local setup process or test credentials available for contributors?\n\nHere‚Äôs my proposed solution:\n\n- Identify the table or container for the roles screen.\n- Apply CSS styles to make the top row sticky.\n- Ensure it works across different screen sizes and remains functional.\n- Test the implementation and verify that scrolling behavior is smooth.\n\nExpected Timeline:\n- End date: [30-March-2025]\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions or additional requirements.
