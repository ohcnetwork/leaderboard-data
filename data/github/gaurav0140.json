Thanks!\n\nETA: 01/04/2025\n"

      "text": "I want to work on this issue. Could you guide me on accessing the Admin Roles page for testing? Is there a local setup process or test credentials available for contributors?\n\nHere‚Äôs my proposed solution:\n\n- Identify the table or container for the roles screen.\n- Apply CSS styles to make the top row sticky.\n- Ensure it works across different screen sizes and remains functional.\n- Test the implementation and verify that scrolling behavior is smooth.\n\nExpected Timeline:\n- End date: [30-March-2025]\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions or additional requirements. Thank You."
