      "text": "@Jacobjeevan  I suspect this issue is related to Tailwind. The component works fine on smaller screen widths but breaks when the width increases, especially at md, lg, or xl breakpoints.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\nI'll investigate and fix the issue by:\nChecking if any w-full, max-w-*, or container classes are affecting responsiveness.\nEnsuring md:flex, lg:grid, or other responsive utilities are correctly applied.\nDebugging overflow-hidden, min-w-0, flex-wrap, and gap-* to prevent layout shifts.\n\n**ETA:** 14 March"
