      "text": "Hello @nihal467 ,\nI'm Vihanga Muthumala and I would like to be assigned to this issue. Below is my proposed solution.\n\n\n**_Solution:_**\n\n**1. Make Password Fields Optional:**\nI will update the schema in `src/components/Users/UserForm.tsx` so that the password and `c_password` fields are not required.\n\n**2. Conditional Confirm Password Validation:**\nI will change the `.refine()` check in the schema so that the `c_password` field is required only when a password is entered.\n\n**3. Update UI Indicators:**\nI will update the form labels and validation messages in both `src/components/Users/UserForm.tsx` and `src/components/Users/UserFormValidations.tsx` to show that the password fields are optional.\n\nOther than this changes I can update the test files to make sure everything works with new changes. I will also test manually to check that the fix works with the backend changes.\n\n\nEnd date by _March 22, 2025._\n\n"
