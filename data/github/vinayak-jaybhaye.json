      "text": "Thanks for this PR! One quick note â€” this image is part of the **preview**, not the final avatar thumbnail. So it should be large enough to clearly review the uploaded image, but still fit inside the dialog.\r\n\r\nFrom the code changes, it looks like the new max size might be **too small** (especially on desktop screens). I recommend testing on different screen sizes to make sure the preview is **visible enough** while still being responsive.\r\n\r\n just wanted to raise this point for discussion.\r\n"
