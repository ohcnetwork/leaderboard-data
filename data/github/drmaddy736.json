But not everybody is going to use ABDM system but just core HMIS functionality for hospital management, so care should work locally with ABDM (certification, compliance, requires software management team)or without it or with SSL or without it or with SMS otp requirements for login or with only admin managed user / password (basic auth) for complete offline use."
