I saw the issue, found it doable, and started working on it. After creating the PR, I noticed you were also working on it. Sorry about that.\n\nThat's okay if the issue is raised by the maintainer of the project, but this issue was raised by the contributor just like you.\n\nMoreover in the contribution guidelines given, it is mentioned that you should first comment below the issue you want to work on.\n\nThis way you are creating an unhealthy environment among contributors."
