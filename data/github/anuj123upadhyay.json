      "text": "@nihal467 @Jacobjeevan  I'm interested in working on this issue and would like to contribute a fix.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nI wanted to work on this by updating the validation logic to allow medicine administration, when the administration timestamp is equal to or later than medicine added .Hence, this includes modifying the date comparison logic in the form validation (to use appropriate comparison operator).\n\nExpected Timeline:\n\nETA: 1-2 days\n\nThis fix avoids false validation errors. Could you please assign this to me???"
