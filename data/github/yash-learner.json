So we will have to alert the user to generate new set of codes? ðŸ¤”\r\n\r\nNice catch @DraKen0009 \r\n\r\nBut practically, I would think this would never or rarely happen. In years I never logged in using a backup code. \r\n\r\nI think instead frontend should redirect user to user settings page whenever user logs in using backup code and prompt them to re-configure TOTP device properly, and this would regenerate the backup codes.\r\n\r\nIf a user ever continuously logs in using backup code, it indicates something is wrong with their totp device.\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nA user can re-generate backup codes anytime as long as they are logged in\r\n\r\n@vigneshhari what do you think should we handle this case ?"
