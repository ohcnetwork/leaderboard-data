So, instead of coding that into the generic component, I think it’s cleaner to have a mobileTrigger prop that way, the parent can pass in whatever custom design it needs (and covered if there’s a new style in the future)\r\n> \r\n> Keeping it flexible like this makes more sense to me\r\n\r\n@AdityaJ2305 approach Looks good to me \r\n\r\n\r\n> The green button style with the plus icon, size difference, etc. is specific to Add Allergy, Add Symptoms, and Add Diagnosis - Vinu confirmed that.\r\n\r\nI think you need to update the `MedicationValuesetSelect` as mobile trigger for mobiles -> `MedicationRequest` and `MedicationStatement` question's as well.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"782\" height=\"1612\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22c78f2d-df54-45a2-bd81-02516f02c5d5\" />\r\n\r\n"

So I think directly editing from collapsible makes sense than opening the sheet from collapsible by clicking edit and then scrolling and finding the notes field and clicking Done again.\n\n- But for not already submitted, we can edit all the fields \n\n\n\n  The expected flow is like filing all the fields and clicking Done in sheet, here I feel if they want to edit a single field it much easier to edit directly from collapsible input with a single click.\n\n   Whereas the using sheet in edit flow as well like makes two clicks → Opening sheet by clicking edit then scroll and find the field they would like to edit. But this is like providing the same UI \n\nIt's a choice we need to make, number of clicks vs using same UI\n\n🤔"
