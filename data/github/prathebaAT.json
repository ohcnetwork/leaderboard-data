      "text": "\nHi @nihal467 , @vigneshhari and @amit-kr-debug \n\nI came across the CARE HR Module project and found it really interesting. I’d love to contribute, especially in areas like backend development (Django), frontend (ReactJS), or dashboard design. As I am learning and improving my skills in these technologies, this project seems like a great opportunity to gain hands-on experience while helping the team.\n\nCould you please guide me on how I can get started? I’m open to any beginner-friendly tasks and eager to learn from your feedback. Looking forward to your response!\n\n\n"
