      "text": "Hi @khavinshankar ,\n\nI’m interested in contributing to the FHIR Risk Assessment project and would love to get a head start. The project looks fascinating, and I’m excited to learn more about how it integrates with the existing CARE architecture.\n\nTo get started, I had a couple of questions:\n\nIs there a specific area within the backend or frontend that requires immediate attention?\nAre there any beginner-friendly issues or tasks that would help me familiarize myself with the FHIR standards and the current codebase?"
