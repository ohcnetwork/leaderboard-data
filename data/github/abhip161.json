Thanks for your guidance!\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19734872-ae99-4ea1-b6a3-99f2c342f17a)\r\n"

      "text": "hey @rithviknishad ,\r\nI see your point about simplifying the classes since the button is disabled when totalBeds is null. However, I think keeping the conditional classes for opacity is helpful for providing visual feedback. It allows users to see that the button is inactive (with reduced opacity) when there are no beds available, enhancing usability.\r\n\r\nBut I'm open to further discussion if you think a simpler approach would be better. Let me know your thoughts!\r\n"
