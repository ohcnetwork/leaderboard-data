Sorry for that. The design you came across was meant for smaller screen sizes. \r\n\r\nalso the sidebar was clickable and would instantly get you to that section of the timeline.  \r\n\r\ni am already working on implementing a similar design to what you shared. Thanks for that. Just putting this out there to actually show you how it was."
