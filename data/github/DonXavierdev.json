It only takes time to upload which already has a progress bar \r\n- Adding large-sized images along with more than 15 images caused the entire website to lag, making it difficult to navigate to the upload button.This prompted me to add a progress bar regardless.\r\n\r\n## Bugs found\r\n\r\nWhen there are a lot of files in the preview it overflows the viewport height . I am planning to open a new issue for this due to separation of concerns. What do you say ?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66351f36-e3b7-4457-9db0-4c75055bffc4\r\n\r\n"

      "text": "@shivankacker \r\n\r\nthe design was:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-12-20 at 11 00 22 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df346f98-5d13-4a37-ae66-d95d5895db13)\r\n\r\nI think i only put it for screen sizes of XL instead of putting it for lg and larger. Sorry for that. The design you came across was meant for smaller screen sizes. \r\n\r\nalso the sidebar was clickable and would instantly get you to that section of the timeline.  \r\n\r\ni am already working on implementing a similar design to what you shared. Thanks for that. Just putting this out there to actually show you how it was."
