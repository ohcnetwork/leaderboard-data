My proposed approach is to initially fetch and display the full list of patients in the Facilities → Patients section. The existing search functionality will remain intact, allowing users to filter the list dynamically as they type.\n\nTo optimize performance, I plan to implement pagination or lazy loading if the patient list is large. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or if there's a preferred approach to follow. Looking forward to your guidance!"
