Where can I find them?\r\nABHA ID will only be present if the patient is linked to ABDM. (The UHID design is futuristic, use patient ID as UHID for now) \r\n> The volunteer object doesn't have a contact number. Should I fetch the volunteer's contact number using the volunteer ID?\r\nVolunteer is a user, you can fetch the details if a volunteer is assigned. (low priority task)\r\n> I have yet to implement the links to the tabs.\r\nLets get this done, All the tab components will become pages and that will be the major change here. lets also make sure each page will take care of its data loading"
