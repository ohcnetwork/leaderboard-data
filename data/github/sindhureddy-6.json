Also, the create questionnaire flow already has some validations, and there’s an open PR adding more for group type and scroll works fine (It is just not observable since submit button is on top and most probably all fields with error are already in view 😅 ) and here the issue was specific of the component not the form here 👍\r\n\r\nokay. i will create separate issue."
