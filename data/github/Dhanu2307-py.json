      "text": "Hi @rithviknishad , I’d like to work on this issue.\n\nI watched the video and noticed that when pressing the Tab key, the cursor doesn’t move through the form fields correctly. I think this might be because of the order of the input fields in the HTML, or maybe some fields are hidden or have extra tabindex settings.\n\n### What I’ll do:\n-I will start by checking the form in the browser to find any hidden or inactive fields. I will make sure all the input fields are visible and ready to use. I will also look at the tabindex settings to remove any that are not needed or causing issues. Then, I’ll make sure the fields are in the right order so the Tab key moves smoothly from one field to the next. After making these changes, I’ll test everything to make sure it works and send a pull request in 1–2 days.\n\n\n\nPlease let me know if I can take this up. Thanks!\n"
