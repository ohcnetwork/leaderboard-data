I have removed the Tooltip Component which was wrapped over the button component responsible for showing \"Expand/Collapse\" and \"See Details\" buttons. As we don't require the tooltip anymore, I've removed that component as well as necessary imports.\n\nExpected Timeline: March 19th, 2025\n\nOutcome:\nThe tooltip isn't visible anymore\n<img width=\"374\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2163c6e1-008a-43d0-8535-6a22e7b196d6\" />"
