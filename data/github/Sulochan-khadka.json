      "text": "@rithviknishad this has been solved by probably two ways. Since Combobox.input does not explicitly support this type of styling , 2 ways seemed to me to get it solved. The easiest way to get this solved was to use any pre-worked feature / library (increasing dependencies), while the other way round was to create from scratch, by working on the stylings , modifying some, and then achieving the required. Do let me know which one to push. I prefer the latter one since combobox consistency will be preserved along with no increase in dependency."
