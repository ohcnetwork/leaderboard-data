      "text": "@rithviknishad, I would like to work on this issue and here's how I would go about solving this issue:\n## Implementation Steps:\n\n#### 1. Identify the Breadcrumb Structure:\n- For locations, the breadcrumb follows: Home > Building 1 > Floor 1\n- For organizations, it could be: Home > State (Kerala) > Organization Name or something similar.\n\n#### 2. Modify the Breadcrumb Component:\n- Reuse and make the necessary changes in the existing Breadcrumb component.\n\n#### 3. Update the Organization View:\n- Fetch the necessary hierarchy details (e.g., state name, organization name).\n- Pass these details to the breadcrumb component.\n\n#### 4. Ensure Navigation Works:\n- Clicking on a breadcrumb should navigate to the respective level.\n\nExpected Timeline:\n- Complete Implementation and submission of pull request: 1-2 days, before 8th March."
