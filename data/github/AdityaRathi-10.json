I made *View All* option for both the *Chronic Conditions* & *Diagnosis* so that it becomes consistent with **symptoms** and **allergies**. Does this solve the issue or I need to do something else as well?"

      "text": "@AdityaJ2305 I have tried to solve this issue but I am not exactly getting where is the issue. The way in which *DiagnosisQuestion* component is written differs a bit from how *SymtomQuestion* and *AllergyQuestion* components are written. These all components share common logic for while the form is submitted in *QuestionnaireForm.tsx* but the problem is only occuring in the case of Diagnosis Form. I have checked for the logic part but I didn't find any bug there like all things are proper. I tried to remove the `exclude_verification_status` key but I guess it is responsible only to decide whether to show the `entered_in_error` rows to the user. Also other status are getting reflected only the problem occurs with *remove_diagnosis*, the status is getting to `confirmed` as if it is some default value. \n\nI am not getting how to proceed from here. Can you help me out about exactly where I am going wrong."
