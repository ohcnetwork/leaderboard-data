      "text": "Proposed Solution: To address this issue, I will investigate the logout functionality and ensure that all form elements are properly reset after logout. It appears that the input labels become unclickable due to DOM elements or event listeners not being properly re-initialized. I plan to ensure that the input labels and other form elements remain interactive without requiring a hard refresh. Additionally, I will check for any JavaScript errors or missing event listeners that could be contributing to the issue.\n\nExpected Timeline: End date: 5 days (I aim to submit the completed pull request within this time frame)\n\nAdditional Context: The fix will be tested across multiple browsers to ensure consistent behavior, and I will verify that the login functionality works smoothly without requiring a page refresh. If necessary, I will implement a soft page refresh or reinitialize the form elements programmatically to maintain a seamless user experience."
