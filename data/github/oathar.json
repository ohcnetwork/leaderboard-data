      "text": "Hi @Sohamnayak4  , thank you for your contribution! I had already worked on this issue and was waiting for the maintainers to assign it to me before opening a PR, as I assumed that was the expected process. @nihal467 @Jacobjeevan @rithviknishad  could you please clarify whether issues need to be assigned before someone starts working on them? Since I have a PR ready, I’d appreciate guidance on how to proceed. \n\n\n"

      "text": "I have reproduced the issue by following the provided steps. The problem seems to be related to the sidebar or certain elements overflowing the viewport in mobile view.\n\nI will implement fixes by ensuring the layout adapts correctly using responsive CSS techniques (e.g., flexbox adjustments, media queries, and ensuring proper width constraints). I will also test across multiple devices to confirm the fix.\n\nExpected timeline:  6March. Please assign me this issue @nihal467 \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3785e28c-23ec-4d59-bea2-4fecc8ac71e3)"
