      "text": "@rithviknishad @shuchitachawla2909 @brainless @giju @Ashesh3 \n**Can i work on this Issue  , I have following approaches:**\n\n**1. Make each appointment entry clickable, redirecting users to the facility details page.\n2. Display key information such as facility name, location, and an embedded map upon navigation.\n3. Ensure smooth navigation with Tailwind or Bootstrap styling for consistency and responsiveness.\n4. As an alternative, add a \"View Facility\" button within the appointment details section.\n5. Validate UX with user testing to confirm ease of access and reduced navigation effort.**"

Add a cancel button or cross icon inside the dropdown for easy dismissal.\n2. Ensure clicking the button resets the dropdown state and restores the previous view.\n3. Use Tailwind or Bootstrap classes to maintain design consistency with other UI elements.\n4. Implement event listeners to handle both button clicks and outside clicks for smooth UX.\n5.

Use responsive design techniques so that the content scales properly without causing overflow or readability issues.\n3. Change the placeholder text for the input box: for the first tab, use \"Enter Aadhaar Number OR Virtual ID,\" and for the second tab, use \"Enter linked ID.\"\n4. Consider adding tooltips to the tabs or input fields to offer additional guidance.\n5. Test the updated design on various mobile devices and screen sizes to confirm that the changes resolve the issues and improve usability.**\n\n@Tanuj1718 @brainless @giju @Ashesh3 @riginoommen "

Ensure the username availability check runs before validating its strength.\n2. Prevent conflicting messages by displaying only the relevant validation result.\n3. Sync frontend and backend password validation logic to avoid mismatches.\n4. Update error handling to prioritize availability errors over strength validation.\n5. Test with different username and password combinations to verify fixes.**"
