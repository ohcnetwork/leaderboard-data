      "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm Mohammed Imaduddin, a pre-final year computer science student from India. I'm interested in this project as the required stack (React, Node.js, TypeScript, Django) aligns well with my expertise.\n\nTo better understand the project, I researched FHIR standards and learned that they are a set of standards for exchanging healthcare data electronically, developed by HL7 to improve interoperability between healthcare systems. I found it particularly interesting that FHIR supports RESTful APIs, making it easy to work with modern web technologies.\n\nTo get hands-on experience, I set up the CARE frontend locally and explored the codebase. Additionally, I was a new contributor in the last release of care_fe, which has given me some familiarity with the project.\n\nIâ€™d love to contribute to this project. Please let me know the next steps and how I can get started"
