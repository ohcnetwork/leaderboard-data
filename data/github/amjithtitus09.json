      "text": "@sainak Please share your feedback for the below approach\r\n### Implementation Plan\r\n\r\nTo make the storage provider configuration more flexible and support multiple types (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Local Storage), this would be my approach:\r\n### 1. Define Abstract Base Class for Storage Providers\r\n\r\nCreate an abstract base class BaseStorageProvider that will define the common interface for all storage providers, ensuring consistency.\r\n### 2. Implement Concrete Storage Provider Classes\r\n\r\nImplement concrete storage provider classes for AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Local Storage, each inheriting from the BaseStorageProvider class.\r\n### 3. Centralize Configuration Management\r\n\r\nUpdate the config.py to handle configuration for all supported storage providers and bucket types (e.g., Patient, Facility). This will include settings for AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Local Storage.\r\n### 4. Create Utility Functions for Storage Provider Initialization\r\n\r\nCreate utility functions in storage_utils.py to initialize and return the appropriate storage provider based on the configuration.\r\n### 5.
