      "text": "@rithviknishad @Jacobjeevan  Hii\nI tinkered with this issue yesterday and found why this happening, it was because of the QuissionaireResponseList component rendering elements when routed from the encounters page. I have also solved this issue using useEffect and scrolling to the top when loading with window.scrollTo function. But i was searching for a better solution as same problems may arise if Encounter Overview component is used somewhere else in the future. \n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8da9b2e-b8ad-4394-b027-bf5a2a30c9cc\n\nAs i have requested the issue from Spandan-Mishra first and worked on it, It would be nice to contribute to this.\n@gaurav0140 I value your feedback and admire your correct fix."
