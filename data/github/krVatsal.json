      "text": "Hey @modamaan, i just tried to reproduce the issue and i can't see anything wrong. The add user feature is working fine, also what i noticed in your video that there is a step missing before confirmation of user created. After filling the form there is one more sidebar  where we are supposed to designate a role to the user and then the user gets created successfully \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efcc1656-d013-4658-9c11-818a5917e518)"
