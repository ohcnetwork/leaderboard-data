      "text": "I’ve triaged issue #12239 as requested. Below is my assessment:\n\n**Bug Description**:\n- When `disableCache` is set to `true`, the `useFilters` hook prevents writing new filters to `localStorage` but does not clear existing cached filters. This causes stale filter data to persist and be restored on page load, leading to unexpected behavior.\n- Impact: Users may see outdated filters applied, affecting the UI and functionality of filterable pages (e.g., patient or facility dashboards).\n\n**Reproduction Steps**:\n1. Apply filters (e.g., `category=emergency`) on a page using `useFilters` with `disableCache: false`.\n2. Refresh the page to confirm filters are cached in `localStorage` (key: `care_filters`).\n3. Update the component to set `disableCache: true`.\n4. Refresh the page again. The cached filters are still applied, despite `disableCache` being `true`.\n\n**Proposed Fix**:\n- Clear the cache using `FiltersCache.invalidateAll()` when `disableCache` is `true` or when `cacheKeys` is empty.\n- Replace `cacheBlacklist` and `disableCache` with `cacheKeys: string[]` for opt-in caching, where only specified keys are cached.\n- Update `useFilters` to:\n  - Call `FiltersCache.invalidateAll()` when `cacheKeys` is empty.\n  - Filter query parameters to only cache keys in `cacheKeys`.\n  - Only restore cache if `cacheKeys` is non-empty.\n- Remove `FILTERS_CACHE_BLACKLIST` as it’s no longer needed.\n\nI’m working on the fix and will submit a PR shortly. Please let me know if additional details."
