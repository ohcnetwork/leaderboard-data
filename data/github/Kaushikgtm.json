The sidebar content is already defined in six different language files within the repository.\nShould I Duplicate the sidebar mapping in the loginpage mapping file for test verification, or Reuse the existing language files directly?"

Translations like sidebar items and button text are already implemented in i18n and LanguageSelector components. However, I’m unsure how to fetch and use these dynamically in the test cases to verify language-specific UI updates."
