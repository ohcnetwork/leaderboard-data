      "text": "Hii @nihal467  The LANGUAGES and resources are managed via i18next, but I cannot figure out how to reference them correctly in the Cypress tests.  Translations like sidebar items and button text are already implemented in i18n and LanguageSelector components. However, Iâ€™m unsure how to fetch and use these dynamically in the test cases to verify language-specific UI updates."
