      "text": "> **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** \"Doctor's Notes\" is confusing for the users. Since the feature is used for TeleICU, rename it to \"TeleICU Notes\"\r\n\r\n@aparnacoronasafe State has suggested to Name it as TeleICU specialist Advice. The term Notes is Very colloquial.\r\nAlso by doing this, i wanted to ask, where wil the spoke doctors enter their advices ? "

      "text": "we have got this feedback from Doctors in Hubli HUB and Bangalore HUB.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is, we have noticed \r\n\r\n1. Nurses also using this chat box, to reply to doctors notes. \r\n2. We have noticed Spoke doctors also using this to put notes to their patients.\r\n3. we have noticed doctors use it as a chat interface, instead of just Orders. \r\n\r\nWhy this is an issue ?\r\n\r\n- On the patient page - there is not quick reference for Doctor's orders. \r\n- On the dashboard, each conversation is considered as a TeleICU consultation. - this is inflating the number of TeleICU consultations . Hence there needs to be a clear demarcation as which is the doctors notes (TeleICU doctor notes) and which are Doctor orders (spoke hospital doctors putting orders and rounds details for their patients) and which are Nurses replies / notes in that chat interface. \r\n "
