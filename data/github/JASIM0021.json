      "text": "Subject: Fix: Duplicate User Data Resolution (PR #11472)\n\nIssue: Duplicate user entries due to multiple API responses.\n\nRoot Cause: API returning redundant user data.\n\nSolution: Implemented unique ID filter in PR #11472.\n\nDetails:\n\nAfter investigating the reported duplicate user issue, I traced the source to the API providing multiple entries for the same user ID. To rectify this, I've added a filter within PR #11472 that ensures only unique user IDs are processed.\n\nThe attached screenshot demonstrates the filter's effectiveness in removing duplicate entries.\n\nRequest: Please review and merge PR #11472 to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nLink: https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/pull/11472\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e6eaef1-ecaa-4258-b530-c9101ff12d68)\n\nAfter applying the filter for unique IDs.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8853228c-4322-439c-acbe-654cc2bc0923)"
