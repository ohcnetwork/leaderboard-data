      "text": "The `LinkDepartmentsSheet` uses a Sheet component (Radix UI) that renders an overlay with `pointer-events: auto` and a high `z-index`, blocking clicks on `sonner` toaster's \"Cross [x]\" and other page elements when open. The modal behavior of the `Sheet` prevents background interactions, and the toasterâ€™s `z-index` may be too low. This causes only sidebar buttons to remain interactive.\n\n@Jacobjeevan if you dont mind id liek to take this up\nETA: 1 Day\n"
