      "text": "This is not a z-index problem.\n\nThe sheet is using modal property so the clicks on any other thing than the side bar are not captured. That’s why even tho the toaster appears we cannot click it. Now I can pass in modal={false} in props in <Sheet /> but it also removes the nice dark overlay that used to come on rest of screen, additionally, because the modal property is set to false the click on any other component than sidebar closes the side bar. This also includes the click on cross [x] to close the toaster.\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "The `LinkDepartmentsSheet` uses a Sheet component (Radix UI) that renders an overlay with `pointer-events: auto` and a high `z-index`, blocking clicks on `sonner` toaster's \"Cross [x]\" and other page elements when open. The modal behavior of the `Sheet` prevents background interactions, and the toaster’s `z-index` may be too low. This causes only sidebar buttons to remain interactive.\n\n@Jacobjeevan if you dont mind id liek to take this up\nETA: 1 Day\n"
