This happened because tooltips open on focus, and when the popover closed, focus automatically returned to the trigger, causing the tooltip to reappear. To fix this, I added onCloseAutoFocus={(e) => e.preventDefault()} to the PopoverContent. This prevents focus from returning to the trigger after the popover closes, which stops the tooltip from being triggered again."

Here's my assessment:\r\n> ## Strengths\r\n> \r\n>     * **Complete Implementation**: You've created a comprehensive 2FA solution with TOTP support, backup codes, and proper user flows.\r\n> \r\n>     * **Security**: Your implementation follows security best practices with temporary tokens and proper authentication flows.\r\n> \r\n>     * **User Experience**: The UI includes clear instructions, error states, and recovery options.\r\n> \r\n>     * **Internationalization**: All strings are properly localized in the en.json file.\r\n> \r\n>     * **Integration**: The changes seamlessly integrate with the existing authentication system.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> ## Implementation Details\r\n> \r\n>     * The authentication flow correctly handles both standard and MFA responses\r\n> \r\n>     * Type guards ensure proper type safety for different response types\r\n> \r\n>     * Backup code generation and management is properly implemented\r\n> \r\n>     * The new `/authenticate` route handles the MFA verification step\r\n> \r\n>     * User profile pages appropriately show 2FA options only for the user's own profile\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Overall, this is a well-architected implementation that follows the codebase's existing patterns and provides a robust 2FA solution.\r\n> ✅ Actions performed\r\n\r\nwhat about a code review\r\n"
