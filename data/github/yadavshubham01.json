This is due to the backend expecting at least one request, and our handler only generating a request if a slot is selected.\r\n\r\nPlease advise on how you’d like to handle this scenario:\r\n- Should we create a generic appointment endpoint for \"reason for visit\" only?\r\n- Or should we require a slot selection if the appointment question is the only question in the questionnaire?\r\n"

Without unique IDs, React cannot properly track and update the selected state for each repeated option, causing selection to break.\n- Ensure that every answer option (and every repeated answer instance) has a unique id property.\n- implement this by generating unique ID using crypto.randomUUID or similar methods to ensure Use this id as the React key and for tracking selection.\n\nETA : Tuesday \n"

This was likely due to the field not being properly initialized or not getting included in the request payload when unchanged.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/791d2c2c-743a-4d14-a32d-668897c457b4)"
