This is due to the backend expecting at least one request, and our handler only generating a request if a slot is selected.\r\n\r\nPlease advise on how you’d like to handle this scenario:\r\n- Should we create a generic appointment endpoint for \"reason for visit\" only?\r\n- Or should we require a slot selection if the appointment question is the only question in the questionnaire?\r\n"

Without unique IDs, React cannot properly track and update the selected state for each repeated option, causing selection to break.\n- Ensure that every answer option (and every repeated answer instance) has a unique id property.\n- implement this by generating unique ID using crypto.randomUUID or similar methods to ensure Use this id as the React key and for tracking selection.\n\nETA : Tuesday \n"

Specifically:\n\nUse position: fixed or absolute with appropriate z-index, top, and left settings.\n\nAdd media queries to adapt width and height for smaller screens (e.g., width: 90vw, max-height: 80vh, and scrollable content if needed).\n\nEnsure the container is scrollable (overflow-y: auto) and doesn’t exceed viewport height.\n\nThis will ensure the modal/pop-up remains fully visible and user-friendly across devices.\n\nExpected Timeline:\nEnd date: 26 March 2025"
