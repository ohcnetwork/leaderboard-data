      "text": "hey @nihal467  @rithviknishad I propose to fix the clipping issue of the patient record pop-up in mobile view by applying responsive design adjustments. Specifically:\n\nUse position: fixed or absolute with appropriate z-index, top, and left settings.\n\nAdd media queries to adapt width and height for smaller screens (e.g., width: 90vw, max-height: 80vh, and scrollable content if needed).\n\nEnsure the container is scrollable (overflow-y: auto) and doesn’t exceed viewport height.\n\nThis will ensure the modal/pop-up remains fully visible and user-friendly across devices.\n\nExpected Timeline:\nEnd date: 26 March 2025"

My approach will involve:\n\nIdentifying all occurrences of the React Date Picker across the platform.\nReplacing it with the native <input type=\"date\">, which triggers the default date picker on mobile devices.\nEnsuring proper styling and compatibility across different browsers and devices.\nTesting the implementation to confirm it improves the UX without breaking any existing functionality.\n\nEnd date: EOD\n"
