      "text": "Hi CARE team, @AdityaJ2305 \n\nI’m super excited to jump into this issue with the Encounter Overview tab not rendering beyond 14 items—what a great challenge! I’ve been exploring CARE and love how it’s transforming healthcare management. With my background in ReactJS and Django (e.g., I optimized a React app to handle large datasets at Modern Vibe Homes), I’d love to tackle this and make those tables sing with all the data they deserve!\n\nHere’s how I’d crush it:\n\n1. **Diagnose the Limit**: Dig into the backend (likely Django) to confirm the 14-item cap—probably a pagination default in the API.\n2. **Boost the Fetch**: Update the API endpoint to support dynamic limits (e.g., `?limit=50`) or fetch all items with a single call if feasible.\n3. **Frontend Flow**: Tweak the React frontend to handle paginated or full data—maybe add a “Load More” button for smooth UX.\n4. **Test the Fix**: Verify with the example encounter ([this link](https://care.ohc.network/facility/605215bd-6215-45dd-bc20-aaeceb474ca1/patient/f3d6590d-adcd-4e0d-9eb3-a5f003dbbee8/encounter/235e330a-4924-4c1a-a871-defead90a16c/updates)) to ensure all allergies show up.\n5. **Polish It**: Optimize performance so it’s snappy even with 50+ items—because healthcare pros need speed!\n\nThis fix could unlock a seamless experience for users tracking tons of allergies or diagnoses—I’m pumped to see it through! Could I take a stab at a PR for this? I’m also eyeing GSoC 2025 with CARE—any chance to chat with the team about this or other ideas? Can’t wait to collab and boost CARE’s impact!\n\nThanks"

      "text": "Hi @khavinshankar, @mathew-alex,\n\nI’m beyond thrilled about the ABDM – Improve the Package Showing Health Information project for GSoC 2025! Enhancing the `hi-profiles` package to showcase comprehensive FHIR-based health data is a fantastic way to empower users with deeper health insights. With my experience in ReactJS, NodeJS, TypeScript, and a growing love for healthcare standards, I’m fired up to take this to the next level.\n\nThis could be a transformative upgrade for ABDM, and here’s how I’d make it epic:\n\n1. **Master the Basics**: Get intimate with CARE, ABDM, and FHIR standards to nail the foundation.\n2. **FHIR Full Power**: Extend `hi-profiles` to support all FHIR profiles—think rich, detailed views like meds, vitals, and conditions in one glance.\n3. **Killer UI**: Redesign the interface with a sleek, interactive layout—maybe a collapsible “Health Snapshot” widget for instant clarity.\n4. **Performance Boost**: Optimize data fetching and rendering to keep it snappy, even with tons of info.\n5. **Rock-Solid Testing**: Build rigorous tests to ensure every profile displays accurately, no compromises.\n6. **User Wow-Factor**: Add a “Trends” feature to visualize health changes over time—because insights matter!\n\nThis could turn `hi-profiles` into a go-to tool for health data, and I’d love to see it shine! I’m drafting a GSoC proposal—would you be game to review it? I could also mock up a quick UI prototype or FHIR profile parser to show my approach. Can’t wait to collaborate with you and make healthcare data sing!\n\nThanks"

      "text": "Hi @shivankacker, @rithviknishad, @tellmeY18,\n\nI’m buzzing with excitement about the IM Bot Wrapper project for CARE in GSoC 2025! CARE’s mission to revolutionize healthcare management is inspiring, and adding a seamless IM bot layer could take user experience to the next level—especially for remote patients and busy hospital staff. With my Python and Django skills, I’m eager to make this a game-changer.\n\nThis feature could truly streamline workflows, and I’ve got some bold ideas to make it shine:\n\n1. **Master CARE**: Dive deep into CARE’s workflow and API structure to ensure a tight fit.\n2. **Generic IM Wrapper**: Build a flexible Python wrapper that any bot (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.) can plug into—think reusable and future-proof.\n3. **WhatsApp Powerhouse**: Craft an intuitive WhatsApp bot with commands like `/records` for patients or `/assets` for staff, all lightning-fast.\n4. **Privacy First**: Hardcode strict PPI checks (e.g., user-specific token validation) to keep data secure—no leaks, ever.\n5. **Smart Notifications**: Add proactive alerts—like “Your meds are due in 1 hour!”—to keep users ahead of the curve.\n6. **Test & Polish**: Write rock-solid tests and optimize for speed, ensuring it’s ready for real-world use.\n\nImagine a nurse checking inventory via WhatsApp in seconds or a patient getting their schedule on the go—this could transform healthcare access! I’m working on a GSoC proposal—would you be up for reviewing a draft? I could also mock up a basic bot flow to show how it’d work. Thrilled to team up with you and boost CARE’s impact!\n\nThanks"

      "text": "Hi @nihal467, @khavinshankar, @sainak,\n\nI’m absolutely pumped about the ABDM – Patient Centric Flows (PHR Flows) project for GSoC 2025! Empowering patients to take charge of their health data through CARE is a massive step toward better healthcare—and I’d love to make it happen. With solid skills in ReactJS, NodeJS, TypeScript, and Django, plus a growing interest in Healthcare IT (e.g., I built a secure data dashboard for a new E-Commerce Based Startup), I’m ready to tackle this challenge head-on.\n\nThis project could redefine patient engagement, and I’ve got some impactful ideas to elevate it:\n\n1. **Deep Dive into ABDM**: Master CARE’s architecture and ABDM module to ensure flawless PHR integration.\n2. **Stunning UI/UX**: Design a sleek, interactive patient portal—think real-time health insights with a gamified twist to boost engagement.\n3. **Rock-Solid Security**: Implement end-to-end encryption and role-based access, exceeding healthcare compliance standards.\n4. **Smart Integration**: Seamlessly sync PHR flows with existing ABDM data, adding a unified “Health Timeline” view for patients.\n5. **AI-Powered Insights**: Suggest personalized health tips based on PHR data (e.g., “Your recent BP trends suggest more hydration!”).\n6. **Bulletproof Testing**: Rigorous unit and integration tests, plus user feedback loops to perfect the experience.\n\nThese features could turn the PHR Flows into a standout tool for patient empowerment! I’m crafting a detailed GSoC proposal—would you be up for reviewing a draft? I could also prototype a secure UI mockup or API integration to show my vision. Thrilled at the chance to collaborate with you and revolutionize healthcare access!\n\n\nThank you!"

      "text": "Hi @dauntlessnomad, @vigneshhari, @mathew-alex,\n\nI’m incredibly excited about the Diet Management module project for CARE in GSoC 2025! As someone passionate about health tech, I see this as a game-changer—empowering patients and healthcare pros to manage nutrition seamlessly within CARE. I’ve been exploring CARE’s frontend (ReactJS) and backend (Django) setup, and I’m thrilled to bring my skills in ReactJS, NodeJS, TypeScript, and Django to make this a reality.\n\nI’ve tackled similar challenges before (e.g., building a unique and customizable model for E-Commerce Startup), and I’m eager to deliver impactful features like meal plan integration, calorie tracking, and personalized nutrition recommendations. Here’s how I’d make it happen:\n\n1. **Dive into CARE**: Get hands-on with the architecture and patient dashboard to ensure tight integration.\n2. **User-Centric Design**: Craft intuitive UI/UX prototypes for meal plans and calorie logs, inspired by user needs.\n3. **Build Core Features**: Develop modular React components for meal plans and calorie tracking, backed by Django APIs.\n4. **Smart Recommendations**: Code logic to generate tailored nutrition tips using patient health data.\n5. **Seamless Sync**: Link diet data to the patient overview with clean, maintainable code.\n6. **Polish & Test**: Rigorous testing (unit + integration) and peer reviews to guarantee quality.\n\nThis module could transform how patients manage their health, and I’d love to see it live in CARE! I’m planning a detailed GSoC proposal—would you be open to reviewing a draft? I could also whip up a quick prototype (e.g., a calorie tracker UI) to kick things off. Excited to collaborate with you all and make a real difference!\n\nThank you"
