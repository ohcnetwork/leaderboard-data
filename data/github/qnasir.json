My approach includes:\n\nInvestigating the Root Cause:\nChecking how the search is implemented (e.g., case sensitivity, sorting order, filtering logic).\nIdentifying whether the issue is due to API response, frontend filtering, or database ordering.\nImplementing Fixes:\nEnsuring 'India' appears at the top when searched.\nImproving search logic to handle special cases.\nChecking for inconsistent data formats or ranking issues in search results.\nTesting:\nVerifying that 'India' appears correctly in the search results.\nEnsuring no unintended side effects on other country searches.\nExpected Timeline:\nðŸ“… End date: 3 days\n\nAdditional Context:\n\nI will align the fix with the projectâ€™s existing search behavior.\nOpen to feedback or alternative approaches if required.\nLooking forward to your approval! ðŸš€"
