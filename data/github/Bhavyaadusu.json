      "text": "Hi @khavinshankar @bodhisha @Neil ðŸ‘‹,\n\nI'm Bhavya, a Computational Biology student from India. I'm deeply interested in healthcare technology, and this project immediately caught my attention combining FHIR-based infrastructure with multi-channel notifications to support palliative care is both meaningful and technically exciting.\n\nI've started going through the CARE 3.0 frontend and backend setup, and I'm especially intrigued by the use of FHIR Subscriptions for real-time medication alerts. I believe this system has the potential to make a real difference in ensuring adherence and improving patient comfort.\n\nAs I prepare my GSoC proposal, I had a few questions:\n\nFor scheduling reminders, would you prefer using a background job system like Celery (Python) or Bull (Node.js), or is this something you'd like to implement within the existing CARE logic?\n\nRegarding automated voice calls, is Twilio Voice your preferred option, or are there other platforms under consideration?\n\nAre user notification preferences (like preferred channels, time windows, roles) already modeled in CARE 3.0, or would this need to be built from scratch?\n\nI'd love the opportunity to contribute and am happy to take on a small issue or open a PR to get more familiar with the codebase. Thank you for such a thoughtful and impactful project ,really excited about the possibility of working on it through GSoC!\n\n"
