      "text": "Hi @yash-learner , Thanks for opening this issue .\nHere is what I will do :\nI will investigate the regression in Tailwind v4 that has removed or altered cursor-pointer. I will test whether the utility class is being overridden, ensure it's enabled in tailwind.config.js, and apply fixes accordingly. If needed, I will propose an alternative approach using @layer base to restore the expected behavior.\n\nExpected Timeline:\n\nInvestigation & Debugging: 1 day\n\nFix Implementation & Testing: 2 days\n\nPR Submission: 2 days from assignment\n\nLooking forward to contributing!\n\nWould you like any adjustments to the proposal? ðŸš€\n"
