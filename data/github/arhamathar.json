      "text": "Today I re-tested the issue and found that the backend now accepts snake_case (e.g. Input should be 'vegetarian', 'diary_free', 'nut_free', 'gluten_free', 'vegan', 'halal', 'kosher' or 'none'). Previously, it expected kebab-case. It seems this was fixed on the backend side. The Update Encounter is working fine now. @rithviknishad "
