      "text": "@Jacobjeevan can you please assign me this issue \n\nDescribe your solution clearly\nTo handle expired appointments efficiently, I will implement an automatic cancellation system. When a user opens the appointment dialog, the system will check if the current date and time have passed the scheduled appointment time. If the appointment is still active and not in a final state (like “Completed” or “Cancelled”), it should be cancelled automatically\n\napproach :- \nI will use a useEffect hook to trigger a function that compares the current time with the appointment’s start_date_time.\nif the current time is greater, the system will call the cancel Appointment \nExpected Timeline\nEnd date: within 24 hours after I've been assigned"
