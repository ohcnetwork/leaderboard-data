      "text": "### **Approach & Solution for Issue #10874**  \n\n1. Modify `LocationRow` to show **\"Edit\" and \"See Details\" buttons** for all locations, including sub-groups.  \n2. Ensure **child locations receive necessary props** for editing and navigation.  \n3. Maintain **indentation and expand/collapse functionality** for better UI.  \n4. Use **recursive rendering** to display buttons dynamically for nested locations.  \n5. Pass **onEdit handlers and links** correctly to enable seamless editing and navigation.  "
