I've tried to keep the logic simple. Am I good to go with this approach, or would you suggest any changes? üòÑ \n\n---\n\n2) Also, I know we usually follow certain conventions ‚Äî like keeping UI text in i18n files and so on ‚Äî but I wasn‚Äôt sure if that‚Äôs required here, so I just used it directly for now.\n\nFor the route check, I used:\n```js\nconst path = usePath() || \"\";\nconst isTreatmentSummaryRoute = path?.includes(\"/treatment_summary\");\n```\n\n- Does this look good?\ncc @AdityaJ2305 @nihal467\n\nIf everything looks fine, I‚Äôll go ahead and raise the PR! üòå \n\n"
