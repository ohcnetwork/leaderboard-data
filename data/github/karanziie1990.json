I just wanted to check if I might be missing a step or if this could be related to data setup or user permissions.\n\nThat said, since I could reproduce and fix the bug for Diagnosis, I’ve gone ahead and implemented the same solution pattern for the other records as well, even though I couldn’t directly observe the bug behavior in those.\n\nWould appreciate any clarification here.  \ncc: @AdityaJ2305 – if you’ve come across this and could share some insight, that’d be super helpful!\n\nThanks! 😊"

I've tried to keep the logic simple. Am I good to go with this approach, or would you suggest any changes? 😄 \n\n---\n\n2) Also, I know we usually follow certain conventions — like keeping UI text in i18n files and so on — but I wasn’t sure if that’s required here, so I just used it directly for now.\n\nFor the route check, I used:\n```js\nconst path = usePath() || \"\";\nconst isTreatmentSummaryRoute = path?.includes(\"/treatment_summary\");\n```\n\n- Does this look good?\ncc @AdityaJ2305 @nihal467\n\nIf everything looks fine, I’ll go ahead and raise the PR! 😌 \n\n"
