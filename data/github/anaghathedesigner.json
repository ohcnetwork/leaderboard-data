The server defaults are all you need for now.\n\nUpdated Figma Files: I have captured the current state of the design, including all iterations, and updated the linked Figma file. These files reflect the work done up to this point and will serve as the base when the block is lifted.\n[https://www.figma.com/design/Z93EYKSa1MdBmXndsMBJSQ/Care---Master?node-id=28638-138227&t=xSaatvYuKp4EG6d9-1](url)"
