      "text": "I would like to take up this issue.\n\nThe current form treats both `password` and `c_password` fields as optional, which leads to unexpected behavior â€” specifically, when submitting without a password, focus shifts to `c_password` instead of `password`.\n\nI will update the `Zod` schema used with `useForm`:\n- Make `password` and `c_password` required when `password_setup_method === 'immediate'` and `!isEditMode`\n- Use `z.string().min(8)` for field-level validation to trigger focus properly\n- Ensure error messages are clear and correctly mapped\n\nThis will ensure both fields behave like other required fields and focus logic works as expected.\n\nETA: EOD\n\n"
