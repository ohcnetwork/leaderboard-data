I went through the project description and found it really exciting, especially knowing that my contributions can have a real-world impact. As I’m new to this organization, I’d love to start by tackling some good first issues before moving on to more advanced challenges.\n\nCould someone please point me in the right direction?\n\nThanks for your help, and I'm looking forward to contributing!"
