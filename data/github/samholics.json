What more antibiotics to be given if he still has fever on the 3rd day?  \r\n\r\nAnswer - (2) cefepime (2 g q8h), or (3) \r\nmeropenem (1 g q8h) or imipenem-cilastatin (0.5 g q6h). \r\nIf the patient is allergic to ß-lactam antibiotics, use (1) aztreonam (2 g q8h) or (2) ciprofloxacin (400 mg \r\nq12h) or \r\nlevofloxacin (750 mg q24h). Add vancomycin (loading dose of 25-30 mg/kg, then 15-20 mg/kg q8-12h) to \r\neach of the above regimens.\r\n\r\n- [ ]  Initial two times gave correct response as the answer mentioned above. but later Medicine name in the question transcripting to others and gave no response. (same question)\r\n- [ ] Audio output and the Green color highlighting of the text is not matching. text highlight is slower than audio. \r\n- [ ] for some scenarios transcription takes longer time than expected\r\n- [ ] Transcription Loading Icon should be more evident. users might think the page is frozen while its transcripting. \r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1zTf9_-iZVFcQ01iyEtQUy6xkvm6BmA6h/view?usp=drivesdk"
