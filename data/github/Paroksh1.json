It ensures the UI reflects any dynamic changes to encounter.discharge_summary_advice.\r\n\r\n1. Also added the discharge_summary_advice field to the EncounterEditRequest type.\r\n2.  Verified the change by logging the value and checking its sync with form state.\r\n\r\nPlease review and let me know if any further changes are needed! "
