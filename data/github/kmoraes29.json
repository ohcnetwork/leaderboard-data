      "text": "\nHello @harshvardhan119 ,\n\nI really like the idea of an AI-powered chatbot to assist new patients with appointment booking and FAQ automation, especially when it comes to doctor availability, specialties, and symptom-based scheduling.\n\nI'd like to highlight a few points though:\n\n- How will the AI chatbot handle complex scenarios? Will it transfer patients to human representatives when needed?\n- Since appointment booking via NLP is one of the features, it's important to support multiple languages (or a common language such as English) and ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.\n\nI also had some other ideas that could be included in the chatbot:\n\n- The chatbot could guide patients with necessary documents and procedures before their visit and send reminders for follow-ups, medications, or test results after their visit.\n- Patients could receive estimated wait times and availability prediction. For instance, the chatbot could offer rescheduling options if wait times are long or show clinics with shorter queues."
