      "text": "I have got a solution for that \nsolution:\nInitial State Tracking:\n\nCapture the initial values of the form fields when the form is first loaded or reset.\nOn-Change Comparison:\n\nEach time a field is changed, compare the current value with the corresponding initial value for that specific field.\nField-by-Field Tracking:\n\nMaintain a flag (like hasFormChanged) that tracks if any field has been modified compared to its initial value.\nReset Logic:\n\nIf a field is changed back to its initial value, reset its modified state, ensuring hasFormChanged becomes false if all fields return to their original values.\nEfficient Comparison:\n\nCompare individual fields rather than the entire form object (avoiding JSON.stringify), resulting in better performance and accuracy.\nEdge Case Handling:\n\nEnsure that if a field is changed but reverted back to the original value, it doesn't falsely indicate that the form has changed.\n\nCan anyone assign me this issue?"
