      "text": "Hey @Tanuj1718 , For tables in medical prescriptions and treatment summaries, I kept horizontal scrolling because forcing them to fit within a small screen (e.g., 500x800) would make the text too small and unreadable at some times. I think keeping a scroll for the table is necessary when it comes to smaller mobile screens. Do let me know your thoughts on that.\r\n\r\ncc: @abhimanyurajeesh "
