Adjusted the grid to 3 columns. Please let me know if this is what you wanted ? and happy to modify if anything @rithviknishad "

For that, we will have to install this [updated](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/discussions/1236#discussioncomment-7375206) headless UI package. I have added a demo.
