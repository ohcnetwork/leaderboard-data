User Input Fields in Location Form**\n- **Bed Type Selection:** User can select the type of bed (e.g., ICU, Standard, etc.).\n- **Number of Beds:** A field to specify how many beds to add (defaults to 1 for each type).\n- **Real-Time Preview:** Dynamically generate a preview of bed names based on existing beds (e.g., `ICU-1`, `ICU-2`, `ICU-3`).\n\n## **2. Real-Time Bed Name Preview**\n- Before submitting, users see a preview of the beds that will be created.\n- If **3 ICU beds already exist** (`ICU-1`, `ICU-2`, `ICU-3`), adding 3 more will show:  \n- If no beds exist, the preview will start from `ICU-1`.\n\n## **3. Optimized API Request Structure**\n- **Do not send the entire list of generated bed names** to avoid memory overhead.\n- Only send **bed type** and **count** in the payload.\n- **Example API Payload:**\n```json\n{\n  \"location_id\": \"12345\",\n  \"bed_type\": \"ICU\",\n  \"count\": 3\n}\n```\n\n## **4. Backend Processing & Database Update**\n- Backend fetches the existing beds of the selected type for that location.\n- Determines the next available bed number.\n- Generates and inserts new beds dynamically.\n- Updates the **parent location records** accordingly.\n\n## **5. Validation Rules**\n- Ensure bed numbers are sequential and unique.\n- Restrict the maximum number of beds per location (if applicable).\n- Prevent duplicate names from being created.\n"
