However, this requirement is not mentioned in the frontend, leading to confusion.\n> \n> ### ✅ Expected Behavior\n> * When users upload a photo, provide an option to **crop the image to a 1:1 ratio** before submission.\n> * Alternatively, **restrict the capture area to 1:1** so users meet the required condition.\n> * If there is a **minimum pixel requirement**, it should be clearly stated in the frontend to avoid confusion.\n> * Proper error messaging should be displayed when an invalid image is uploaded.\n> \n> ### 🔧 Proposed Solution\n> 1. **Implement a cropping tool** to allow users to adjust images to a **1:1 ratio**.\n> 2. **Update the frontend UI** to display the **minimum pixel requirement** for images.\n> 3. **Improve error handling**:\n>    \n>    * If an image does not meet the pixel requirement, show a **clear error message**.\n>    * Allow images of any resolution as long as they maintain the **1:1 ratio**.\n> \n> ### ⏳ Expected Timeline\n> * **End date**: [Insert your expected completion date, e.g., April 25, 2025]\n> \n> 🔹 **Please assign this issue to me so I can begin working on it.** 🚀\n\nAlready Solved in my PR its reviewed also ...

User Input Fields in Location Form**\n- **Bed Type Selection:** User can select the type of bed (e.g., ICU, Standard, etc.).\n- **Number of Beds:** A field to specify how many beds to add (defaults to 1 for each type).\n- **Real-Time Preview:** Dynamically generate a preview of bed names based on existing beds (e.g., `ICU-1`, `ICU-2`, `ICU-3`).\n\n## **2. Real-Time Bed Name Preview**\n- Before submitting, users see a preview of the beds that will be created.\n- If **3 ICU beds already exist** (`ICU-1`, `ICU-2`, `ICU-3`), adding 3 more will show:  \n- If no beds exist, the preview will start from `ICU-1`.\n\n## **3. Optimized API Request Structure**\n- **Do not send the entire list of generated bed names** to avoid memory overhead.\n- Only send **bed type** and **count** in the payload.\n- **Example API Payload:**\n```json\n{\n  \"location_id\": \"12345\",\n  \"bed_type\": \"ICU\",\n  \"count\": 3\n}\n```\n\n## **4. Backend Processing & Database Update**\n- Backend fetches the existing beds of the selected type for that location.\n- Determines the next available bed number.\n- Generates and inserts new beds dynamically.\n- Updates the **parent location records** accordingly.\n\n## **5. Validation Rules**\n- Ensure bed numbers are sequential and unique.\n- Restrict the maximum number of beds per location (if applicable).\n- Prevent duplicate names from being created.\n"
