      "text": "@rithviknishad , i have worked on this issue at my intern can you assign me this issue \n\nSolution :  To fix the tab navigation issue, ensure that all input fields are visible, enabled, and follow a logical order in the HTML structure. Remove any unnecessary tabindex attributes that might override the natural tab flow, and double-check that no JavaScript is interfering with default keyboard navigation. Using browser developer tools, test the tab behavior across the form to confirm that focus moves sequentially from one field to the next as expected.\n\nEND DATE : Today  "
