Use the same logic for both expanded and collapsed sidebar states so the highlight always matches the user's current location.\n\nissue 2 solution : \n- make the sidebar highlight a tab if the current route starts with that tab’s base path, so even when navigating to deeper pages (like a specific encounter), the main section (e.g., \"Encounters\") stays visibly active. This keeps users oriented, no matter how deep they go.\n\nEND DATE : TODAY"

If nurses need the camera feed to make faster decisions, we should be  okay with them seeing it — but they must not control it. We’ll strictly log all access and review compliance**\n"
