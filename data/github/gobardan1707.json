Remove any unnecessary tabindex attributes that might override the natural tab flow, and double-check that no JavaScript is interfering with default keyboard navigation. Using browser developer tools, test the tab behavior across the form to confirm that focus moves sequentially from one field to the next as expected.\n\nEND DATE : Today  "
