      "text": "The current issue is that feature tags in the facility editor become unreadable on hover due to a lack of contrasting background styles. This is caused by missing hover background color classes in the FeatureBadge component located at src/pages/Facility/Utils.tsx.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nI will update the variantStyles object in the FeatureBadge component to include hover:bg-{color}-200 Tailwind classes for all tag variants. This ensures the background color lightens on hover while maintaining readability against the dark text (text-{color}-800).\n\nAdditional Context:\n\n    Affected File: src/pages/Facility/Utils.tsx\n\n    Platform: Windows / Chrome v132.0.6834.111\n\n    Fix verified visually for all variants\n\n    Screenshots and diff confirm issue resolution\n\n\nETA - ASAP"
