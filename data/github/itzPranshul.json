      "text": "Hello Team!\nI'm truly excited about the \"Integrate Beckn as Plug\" project for GSoC and would love the opportunity to contribute. The vision of enabling decentralized, interoperable healthcare systems deeply resonates with me. With experience in ReactJS, NodeJS, Django, TypeScript, and a strong interest in API integrations and open protocols, I'm confident in my ability to implement the Beckn connector, build standardized API endpoints, and ensure seamless plug integration within CARE.\n\nI'm also eager to dive deep into Beckn protocol standards, ensuring full compliance and secure data exchange while preserving CARE’s current structure. If it helps, I’d be happy to draft a short proposal for initial feedback.\n\nLooking forward to your guidance and excited to get started on this impactful integration!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Hi Team!\nI'm enthusiastic about contributing to the Diet Management module in CARE for this year’s GSoC. My experience with ReactJS, NodeJS, Django, and TypeScript aligns well with the technical needs of the project. I'm particularly interested in building meal planning, calorie tracking, and diet data integration with patient records to enhance the overall user experience.\n\nIf helpful, I’d be glad to share a brief proposal for your feedback and approval.\n\nI’ve also been thinking of a few extra features that could complement the core goals:\n\nExcited to get involved and learn from the community—looking forward to your thoughts!"
