      "text": "@khavinshankar Sure, I haven't had much success with triggering/displaying the drop down results. My approach has been to call fetchOptions under onClick (which I added as prop added to UserAutocompleteFormField.Autocomplete and called under Combobox.Input).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"514\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/assets/40040905/95dab763-6bbf-4bbe-b7de-b77e8a232111\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"514\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/assets/40040905/e8387817-d79b-4015-a208-b17d7378b745\">\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I have been able to prefetch results using useQuery in UserAutocompleteFormField, although I'm unsure on how to attach that to options and trigger the dropdown."
