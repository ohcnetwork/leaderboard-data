As shown in the screenshots, the issue was due to space-x-6 on the tabs, which caused horizontal scrolling on smaller screens. After changing it to space-x-4, the issue was resolved. For other pages, like the Questionnaire page, the horizontal scroll is caused by the table overflowing, which breaks the layout.

Please check deployed Preview i have handled that case.\n\nTo clarify; I meant the first time it fetches the data (navigates to 2nd page for example, fetches the data because it's the first time that data would be cached). If you go to page 1 and then navigate back to page 2, there's no fetching as data would be cached.\n\nI've checked the preview - to illustrate my point, check the recording you posted above, when you go from page 1 to 2, skeleton loader won't be triggered as there's placeholder data."

Could you please confirm if this issue is occurring on your side as well?\r\n> \r\n> If it’s not an isolated issue and is happening globally, it might be related to how useState is being used inside the onSelect handler. I haven't been able to pinpoint the exact cause yet. It would be greatly appreciated if you could share any insights on how to fix this, as I plan to address it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI think the issue is due to to component lifecycle and how it handles hook recreation - when isPdf changed, hook is recreated, but the component is also re-rendered (I'm assuming there's some issue with event handling/file input going on at this stage).\r\n\r\nA cleaner approach would be to create a checkbox option within the existing dialog box and then pass it as a variable to fileupload.handleFileUpload, while maintaining the state only within FileUploadDialog component."

      "text": "> **Test Report**\r\n> \r\n> **Functionality Bug**\r\n* [x]  When you search for a username, the input field disappears. It only reappears after clearing the badge. Please revert this to the original behavior where the search field remains visible at all times.\r\n* [x]  Similar issue noticeable for advanced filter as well\r\n* [x]  Disable the \"Add Facility\" button for non-admin users on their own pages.\r\n* [x]  Allow non-admin users to unlink their home facility and any facility in their access.\r\n* [x]   The avatar on the user profile page and the profile icon are different. Please make them consistent.\r\n* [x]  Reset the component's state after the password has been successfully changed.\r\n\r\n> **Question For Clarity**\r\n>     * [ ]  Only the account owner should be able to edit their own user information. However, with your current PR, an admin can edit other users' profiles. Is this the intended behavior?\r\n\r\nYep, that's the intention. \r\n\r\n>     * [ ]  The new profile view details page and the personal profile page display nearly identical data. Could we consider combining them into a single page for simplicity and consistency? [Discuss with the core team].\r\n\r\nYep, we are merging those (removing current profile page), I was waiting on it since there was an intern PR open updating elements in Profile page. We can open an issue that interns can take up once this is merged\r\n\r\n* [x]  Ensure the first column remains fixed in the mobile view for the user list. This will improve accessibility and ease of navigation.\r\n\r\n>     * [ ]  Add a \"Last Modified\" column in the user view page to display the date and time when the profile was last updated. Additionally, consider implementing an alert system to notify users to reverify their profile details after a period of 6 months or 1 year. This will help ensure that user information remains up-to-date. [Discussion required with core team before proceeding]\r\n\r\n🤔  Yea could do for enhancement.\r\n\r\nHere are the tests passing locally:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"605\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3592e7fd-be89-48b9-b934-fb059f4eecda\">\r\n\r\nDetails on the error (screenshot below). I sometimes encounter this when testing after resetting the db; bypass it by manually logging in the cypress window.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a897b218-2cbd-48cd-b59a-f7a687029d19)\r\n"

Not only that, but the distinctions between NP/SFM/HFNC isn't as clear.\n\n[<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cb75c19-6cf4-4ddf-854d-f7a0d53849b4\" width=\"400\" />](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cb75c19-6cf4-4ddf-854d-f7a0d53849b4)\n\n[<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94ce7324-9df0-488b-aaf0-df350f1a0a4e\" width=\"400\" />](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94ce7324-9df0-488b-aaf0-df350f1a0a4e)\n\n"

My approach has been to call fetchOptions under onClick (which I added as prop added to UserAutocompleteFormField.Autocomplete and called under Combobox.Input).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"514\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/assets/40040905/95dab763-6bbf-4bbe-b7de-b77e8a232111\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"514\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/assets/40040905/e8387817-d79b-4015-a208-b17d7378b745\">\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I have been able to prefetch results using useQuery in UserAutocompleteFormField, although I'm unsure on how to attach that to options and trigger the dropdown."
