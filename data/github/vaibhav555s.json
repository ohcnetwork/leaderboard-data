      "text": "### Comment to be posted on Issue #11751\n\nHi @Jacobjeevan ,\n\nI'd love to work on this issue.\n\n**Proposed Solution**:\n- Implement a scheduled job (e.g., cron task) that runs daily to check all appointments with:\n  - `status: \"booked\"` and  \n  - `appointmentDate < currentDate`.\n- Based on the business logic, update the status to `\"completed\"` or `\"missed\"`.\n- Ensure the update is cleanly handled in the backend (or frontend logic if applicable).\n- Optionally trigger notifications if required.\n\n**Proposed Solution**:\nI will fix it within 24 hours after I get assigned\n\nLet me know if there's any existing function or preferred structure you'd like me to follow. Looking forward to contributing!\n"
