      "text": "I would like to work on this feature to add a role-based filtering option \n\nSteps:\n- I will enhance the search bar by adding a dropdown option that enables users to filter by role, alongside the existing username and phone number filters.\n- Logic can be implemented in Frontend as the data is already being fetched. No changes in the Backend! \n- Dropdown Menu will contain all the roles\n- Upon selecting a role, the user list will dynamically update to display only users with the selected role, without requiring a page reload.\n\n### Expected Timeline:\nEnd date: **11/03/2025**\n\nPlease assign me this issue. Thank you!"

      "text": "To solve the issue we can implement following solutions:\n- Month/Year Dropdown: A dropdown for both months and years would be the most optimal solution as it allows users to quickly select a month and year from a dropdown instead of manually navigating month by month. It will also significantly reduce the number of taps needed.\n- Calendar Input Field: This could be an alternative if not dropdown, this will enable users to manually enter the start and end dates via an input field for previous dates as well, providing a quicker alternative to the date picker UI."

      "text": "Hello Team!, I'd love to contribute to the Diet Management module in CARE for GSoC. My experience with ReactJS, NodeJS, TypeScript, and Django aligns well with the project requirements. I'm eager to work on meal plan integration, calorie tracking, and patient record sync while ensuring a seamless user experience. Looking forward to your guidance on getting started!\nIf requested i can share a quick proposal for the team to review and approve.\n\nAdditionally, we can also implement if required:\n- Meal reminders, sending notifications to users for their scheduled meals based on their diet plan.\n- Basic diet progress tracker, showing trends in calorie intake and nutritional balance over time.\n- AI-driven hydration reminders, which analyze meal intake and activity levels to suggest optimal water consumption throughout the \n   day.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
