      "text": "Hi @maintainers,\r\n\r\nI reviewed the OTP resend functionality and found that when the OTP fails to send, a feedback message is already triggered. The error handling is implemented in the handlePydanticErrors function inside ErrorHandler.ts, and I was able to see the corresponding toast notification during testing.\r\n\r\nSince failure feedback was already in place, I focused on adding feedback for a successful OTP resend, as there was no notification for it. I made sure not to alter the existing failure handling and only implemented the missing success feedback.\r\n\r\nLet me know if any further changes are needed. "
