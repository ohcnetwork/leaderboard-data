      "text": "> Let's keep the solution simple, I'd say we can simply say update the label to \"Description (supports markdown)\"\n\nTrue, we could just change the label to be \"Description (supports [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/))\" and perhaps hyperlink \"markdown\" in the label to some markdown documentation. \n\nThis way users who are unfamiliar with markdown can just click the link to learn more.\n\n@rithviknishad do you think it would be nice to still have an example/template in the description as a placeholder as outlined? \n\nEither way, I'm confident I could have a  simple pr ready for review in a day or two :)"

      "text": "Hi @abhimanyurajeesh , I think this would be a great first issue!\n\nHere's what I would do if I were to be assigned:\n\n-  Having a markdown template perhaps as a placeholder to only show the essentials ( headings, bold text, bullet points)\n-  The markdown template would use example placeholder text pertaining to a facility/hospital to give users better context\n-  more detailed information on using markdown by having a link next to the description label (perhaps using a tooltip)\n\nA question I have is:\n- Should embedding of images/urls using markdown be allowed on descriptions?\n\nAdditional considerations:\n- I think the preview or rich in-built editors are also good solutions, that could be added later on.\n\nIf assigned, I'm confident I could have a PR ready in 1-2 days.\n"
