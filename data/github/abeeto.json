The way in which _DiagnosisQuestion_ component is written differs a bit from how _SymtomQuestion_ and _AllergyQuestion_ components are written. These all components share common logic for while the form is submitted in _QuestionnaireForm.tsx_ but the problem is only occuring in the case of Diagnosis Form. I have checked for the logic part but I didn't find any bug there like all things are proper. I tried to remove the `exclude_verification_status` key but I guess it is responsible only to decide whether to show the `entered_in_error` rows to the user. Also other status are getting reflected only the problem occurs with _remove_diagnosis_, the status is getting to `confirmed` as if it is some default value.\n> \n> I am not getting how to proceed from here. Can you help me out about exactly where I am going wrong.\n\nI managed to get it fixed in my draft PR,  setting `dirty` prop to `true` in the `handleRemoveDiagnosis` fn did the trick."

TableCell got a `whitespace-wrap`  added which is why my code was no-longer working, as I have a useEffect that needs to check if text is wrapping in order to render the expand.\r\n\r\nAdded a quick fix by just overriding the class to  `whitespace-normal`  for this particular `TableCell` element.\r\nPlease have a look now, should work!"
