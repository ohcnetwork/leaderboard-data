      "text": "Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹\n\nI'm Maryam Osman, a second-year Computer Science and Engineering student, passionate about using technology to solve real-world problemsâ€”especially in healthcare. \n\nI'm very interested in contributing to the CARE Instant Messaging Integration project for GSoC 2025. Iâ€™ve gone through the product documentation and the proposal idea, and Iâ€™m excited about building a generic IM wrapper and a WhatsApp bot to make CARE more accessible for patients and hospital staff. I believe this can significantly improve usability and communication in underserved areas.\n\nI have hands-on experience with Python, Django, REST APIs, and Docker. I've previously built full-stack applications and worked in DevOps . Iâ€™m confident these skills align well with the technical requirements of the project.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on the best way to get started contributing and preparing for the proposal. Also, Iâ€™m happy to help with any existing issues or improvements if needed!\n\nLooking forward to working with you all."
