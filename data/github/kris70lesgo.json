      "text": "Hi @rithviknishad ,\n\nHere‚Äôs my proposed approach to address the issue:\n\nObjective\nMake the t function type-safe to catch invalid keys at compile time and enable autocompletion.\n\nSteps\nExtract Keys from Translation Files:\n\nWrite a script to parse all JSON files in public/locales, flatten nested keys, and generate a translationKeys.d.ts file containing a TranslationKeys type.\nExtend i18next:\n\nCreate a declaration file (src/i18n/i18next.d.ts) to extend i18next with TranslationKeys.\nAutomate Key Generation:\n\nAdd a script (generate-keys) to automate the creation of translationKeys.d.ts whenever translation files are updated.\nUpdate Configuration:\n\nUse the generated TranslationKeys in i18next to enforce type safety."
