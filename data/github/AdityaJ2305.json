We can set the relevant values for both doctors and nurses while keeping it undefined for other user types.

Could you please adjust this accordingly?\r\n\r\n\r\n> @chakribontha, in the screenshot, three facilities are selected: `testing, Thiruvananthapuram`  `Testing Other, Thiruvananthapuram` and `Testing Other12313, Thiruvananthapuram` with “3 selected” shown as text. Clicking the clear icon should only remove the “3 selected” text, not the selected facilities below.
