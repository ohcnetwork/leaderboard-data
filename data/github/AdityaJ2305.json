Here's how to implement it:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Update the translation keys in `public/locale/en.json`:\r\n> \r\n> ```json\r\n> {\r\n>   \"entity_count_one\": \"{{count}} {{entity}}\",\r\n>   \"entity_count_other\": \"{{count}} {{entityPlural}}\"\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> 2. When using the translation, provide both singular and plural forms:\r\n> \r\n> ```ts\r\n> t(\"entity_count\", {\r\n>   count: facilities?.count || 0,\r\n>   entity: \"Facility\",\r\n>   entityPlural: \"Facilities\"\r\n> })\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> This approach will handle irregular plurals correctly (like \"person\"/\"people\") instead of just adding 's' to the singular form. Would you like me to help you implement this change across all the files?\r\n> \r\n> 🔗 Analysis chain\r\n> 🏁 Scripts executed\r\n\r\nHey Team, Do we really need to do that ? It just makes it too complex for simple translation"

We can set the relevant values for both doctors and nurses while keeping it undefined for other user types. This approach would minimize backend changes.\r\n<img width=\"844\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 11 08 13 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b79ef4d-f188-43c8-bd1c-cdacf15e9653\">\r\n"
