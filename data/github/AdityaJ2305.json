Since I’m not aware of all the required validations (only know about choice questions), we can create a separate issue for it. This issue mainly focuses on minor bugs. If you agree, please do edit the issue description otherwise it could be confusing for reviewers and testing "

Here's how to implement it:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Update the translation keys in `public/locale/en.json`:\r\n> \r\n> ```json\r\n> {\r\n>   \"entity_count_one\": \"{{count}} {{entity}}\",\r\n>   \"entity_count_other\": \"{{count}} {{entityPlural}}\"\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> 2. When using the translation, provide both singular and plural forms:\r\n> \r\n> ```ts\r\n> t(\"entity_count\", {\r\n>   count: facilities?.count || 0,\r\n>   entity: \"Facility\",\r\n>   entityPlural: \"Facilities\"\r\n> })\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> This approach will handle irregular plurals correctly (like \"person\"/\"people\") instead of just adding 's' to the singular form. Would you like me to help you implement this change across all the files?\r\n> \r\n> 🔗 Analysis chain\r\n> 🏁 Scripts executed\r\n\r\nHey Team, Do we really need to do that ? It just makes it too complex for simple translation"

We can set the relevant values for both doctors and nurses while keeping it undefined for other user types. This approach would minimize backend changes.\r\n<img width=\"844\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 11 08 13 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b79ef4d-f188-43c8-bd1c-cdacf15e9653\">\r\n"
