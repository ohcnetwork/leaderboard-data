      "text": "Hey @AdityaJ2305  , I completely understand your concern, and I truly respect the effort you've put into the issue. I wasn’t aware that you were actively working on it, as there was no assignment or prior message indicating it. From what I saw, there was only a general interest expressed, but no clear confirmation from the admin. My intention was solely to contribute and help out, not to override anyone’s work.\n\nThat said, I’d be happy to coordinate with you and find a way to collaborate rather than duplicate efforts. Let me know how you'd like to proceed. Apologies for any confusion, and I appreciate your contributions\n\n@shivankacker "
