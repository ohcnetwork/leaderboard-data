      "text": "Iâ€™ve reviewed the problem and I believe I can fix the responsive layout issue that occurs when the screen size drops below 633px x 530px on the Nearby Facility page for patient login.\n\nðŸ”§ Proposed Solution:\nApply proper responsive styling using media queries or flex/grid layouts to ensure UI components stack or resize appropriately.\n\nTest across various screen sizes to make sure the view renders well on smaller resolutions.\n\nIf necessary, add scroll or responsive modals to handle content overflow.\n\nðŸ“… Expected Timeline:\nEnd date: April 6, 2025\n\nðŸ“Ž Additional Context:\nLet me know if you have any specific design expectations for the mobile view, or if I should follow the current layout pattern.\n\nPlease assign this issue to me @Tiskae  @hrit2773  @maishivamhoo123  @brainless  @giju .
