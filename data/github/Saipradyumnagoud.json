      "text": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'd like to work on this issue.\n\nIâ€™ve identified the problem where past appointments (e.g., from April 2nd) are still showing as \"Booked\" even though today is April 4th. I will implement a date-based logic to automatically update the status of appointments once their scheduled date has passed.\n\nðŸ“… Expected end date: April 6, 2025 (within 24 hours)\n\nPlease assign this issue to me @Jacobjeevan . Thank you!\n\n"

      "text": "Iâ€™ve reviewed the problem and I believe I can fix the responsive layout issue that occurs when the screen size drops below 633px x 530px on the Nearby Facility page for patient login.\n\nðŸ”§ Proposed Solution:\nApply proper responsive styling using media queries or flex/grid layouts to ensure UI components stack or resize appropriately.\n\nTest across various screen sizes to make sure the view renders well on smaller resolutions.\n\nIf necessary, add scroll or responsive modals to handle content overflow.\n\nðŸ“… Expected Timeline:\nEnd date: April 6, 2025\n\nðŸ“Ž Additional Context:\nLet me know if you have any specific design expectations for the mobile view, or if I should follow the current layout pattern.\n\nPlease assign this issue to me @Tiskae  @hrit2773  @maishivamhoo123  @brainless  @giju .
