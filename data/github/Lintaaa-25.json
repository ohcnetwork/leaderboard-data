      "text": "Hi! üëã\n\nI noticed this issue has been marked as stale, and there hasn't been any recent activity. I'd like to work on this and submit a fix.\n\nFrom what I see, the issue seems to stem from event propagation when using select or selectContent inside EntitySelectionSheet. I plan to prevent the sheet from closing by stopping event propagation (e.stopPropagation()) and, if needed, refining the outside click handler to ignore interactions within dropdowns.\n\nPlease let me know if it's okay for me to take this on!\n\nThanks!"
