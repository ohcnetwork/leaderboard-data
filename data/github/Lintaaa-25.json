      "text": "Hi team,\nI’d like to take up this issue as part of my GDC AI Internship, to add support for rescheduling existing care slots to another doctor or nurse within the facility.\nI have reviewed the feature requirements and believe I can implement this with proper validation to ensure seamless reassignment while maintaining data integrity.\nBased on initial assessment, I estimate about 2 to 4 days to deliver a robust solution including testing.\nLooking forward to contributing!"
