      "text": "Hi @Jacobjeevan.\nCould you please assign this to me? I already have a fix for it. \n\n**Describe your solution clearly:**\n1.\tMake the phone number div a flexbox.\n2.\tGive it a flex direction of column.\n3.\tAlign the items in the flex box to the end. This will align the phone number and its value to the far right of the card. \n\n**Expected Timeline:**\n- End date: 24 hours from time of assignment \n\n**Additional Context:**\nThis approach works for all screen sizes. See screenshot below to see what the end result would look like. \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/986ca4ae-0e9b-4e9d-8439-08fe1d3b72b9)\n"
