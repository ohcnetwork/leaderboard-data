      "text": "Hello ðŸ‘‹\n\nIâ€™d like to work on this task of replacing custom Popover + Calendar combinations with the standardized DatePicker component across the codebase.\n\nProposed Solution:\nI plan to locate all instances where Calendar from @/components/ui/calendar is used alongside a custom Popover, and systematically replace these with the reusable DatePicker component already present in the shared UI library. Iâ€™ll verify each replacement by manually testing the component and reviewing how the date is handled internally.\n\nExpected Timeline:\nEnd date: July 5, 2025 (including testing and review buffer)\n\nPlease let me know if I can take this forward. Thanks!"

Iâ€™ll also add a quick test to cover this edge case and verify everything works in the UI.\n\nETA\nI plan to have a PR ready within 24 hours after being assigned the task to resolve this issue.\n\nThanks! ðŸ˜Š"
