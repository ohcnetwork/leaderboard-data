Making filter-tabs component support icons and labels\r\n2.

      "text": "Hello 👋\n\nI’d like to work on this task of replacing custom Popover + Calendar combinations with the standardized DatePicker component across the codebase.\n\nProposed Solution:\nI plan to locate all instances where Calendar from @/components/ui/calendar is used alongside a custom Popover, and systematically replace these with the reusable DatePicker component already present in the shared UI library. I’ll verify each replacement by manually testing the component and reviewing how the date is handled internally.\n\nExpected Timeline:\nEnd date: July 5, 2025 (including testing and review buffer)\n\nPlease let me know if I can take this forward. Thanks!"

I’ll also add a quick test to cover this edge case and verify everything works in the UI.\n\nETA\nI plan to have a PR ready within 24 hours after being assigned the task to resolve this issue.\n\nThanks! 😊"
