      "text": "@Jacobjeevan below is my proposal for this issue. Please assign it if it looks good to you, and let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.\n\n**Proposed Solution Description:**\nI propose adding the `break-words` class to the `Popover` component to ensure consistent text wrapping across all popover instances. This will prevent text overflow by allowing long words to break and wrap within the popover container.\n\n**Specific change:**\n- Add `break-words` to the existing classes in the popover className.\n\n**Expected Timeline:**\nEnd date: 06-03-2025."

      "text": "@sj11105 \n\n**Solution Description:**\nI propose to modify the Zod validation schema in the `CreateScheduleTemplateSheet` component to prevent creating schedule templates with past dates. The solution involves:\n- Adding date refinement for `valid_from` to allow today or future dates\n- Adding date refinement for `valid_to` to allow strictly a future date.\n- Implementing custom error messages for clear user feedback\n\n**Expected Timeline:**\nEnd date: 05-03-2025"
