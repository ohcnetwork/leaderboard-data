At least some of the tests are related from what I can see, get those working, we can look at the rest after.\r\n> \r\n> Get local [backend](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care) ([Docs](https://care-be-docs.ohc.network/local-setup/configuration.html)) working to run and test cypress locally.\r\n\r\nI ran the tests that were failing due to `li[data-sonner-toast] div[data-title]` not being found, locally using `npm run cypress:open`. I have noted the details and would appreciate discussing them at your convenience."
