      "text": "Can anyone please help me implement the closeNotification cypress command? following is what i have found so far:\r\n  ðŸ“Œ sonner documentation:\r\n\r\n[**[Dismissing toasts programmatically](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/other#dismissing-toasts-programmatically)**](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/other#dismissing-toasts-programmatically)\r\n\r\nTo remove a toast programmatically use `toast.dismiss(id)`. The `toast()` function return the id of the toast.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst toastId = toast('Event has been created'); toast.dismiss(toastId);\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also dismiss all toasts at once by calling `toast.dismiss()` without an id.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntoast.dismiss();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, Iâ€™m unsure how to implement this in Cypress :(\r\n\r\n**ðŸ“Œ Alternative method:** Dismiss by dragging\r\n\r\nclick â†’ hold â†’ drag upwards\r\n\r\ni tried implementing this as follows\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nCypress.Commands.add(\"closeNotification\", () => {\r\n  cy.get(\"li[data-sonner-toast]\")\r\n    .should(\"exist\")\r\n    .trigger('mousedown', { which: 1, force: true })\r\n    .trigger('mousemove', { clientY: 0, force: true })\r\n    .trigger('mouseup', { force: true });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it doesnâ€™t work as expected. Any suggestions?"
