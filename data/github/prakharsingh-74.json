      "text": "hey @Srayash, The issue occurs due to a z-index or pointer-events conflict between the sidebar and the toaster notification. When the sidebar opens, it likely introduces an overlay or element that blocks interaction with the toast. I will resolve this by ensuring the toast container has a higher z-index than the sidebar and that no overlay is intercepting clicks. Iâ€™ll also verify that the toast is rendered outside the sidebar's DOM tree to avoid stacking issues. \n\nexpected time -> 1-2 days(max)\n\nplease assign me this issue"
