      "text": " I’ve tested this in both Windows and Linux environments and confirmed that the issue is indeed related to path resolution differences between platforms.\n\nIt’s not OS-specific behavior, but rather a result of using hardcoded paths instead of platform-agnostic resolution.\n\nUsing path.resolve or path.posix normalizes the file path, resolving the issue cleanly across both environments.\n\nIf you're okay with it, I’d be happy to create a PR to fix this — it would improve cross-platform compatibility for all contributors.\n\nLet me know if I can proceed."

      "text": "Thanks for the follow-up! \nThe error occurs because vite-plugin-static-copy expects pdf.worker.min.mjs to exist under:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14a6699a-cec4-41f8-969d-aea5de29aa19)\n\nThis file may not exist in dev builds or when pdfjs-dist version changes .The plugin fails silently if the file isn’t found, leading to runtime PDF preview issues\n\nThe backend (running via Docker) is irrelevant in this failure — it doesn't serve the worker or static files.\nSo even if minio or other backends are up, this issue still occurs due to frontend worker misconfiguration. \n\nYou can reproduce the error as specified in  video :\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebbb8ff4-37f5-4dab-aa3f-6294489c0a80"
