      "text": ">  Ensure proper handling of pincode autofill behavior. When a user inputs a pincode that corresponds to a region outside the autofilled district (e.g., a non-Ernakulam district pincode while on the Aluva organization page), display a prompt confirming the change. The prompt should ask the user if they want to proceed with updating the State and District fields to reflect the new pincode (e.g., new State: Kerala, new District: Ernakulam).\r\n\r\n@nihal , @rithviknishad I think this feature may not be needed because:\r\n\r\n- Allowing users to enter a mismatched pincode for a specific geography (e.g., Aluva) may lead to incorrect records.. It's better to ensure the pincode matches the organization’s location.\r\n- If a user enters the different pincode, clearing the field already restores the correct autofill values, making additional prompts unnecessary.\r\n- Facilities should remain tied to their correct geography to avoid confusion or incorrect records.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrect me if i am wrong, i will take your input and will do suggested changes "

I'd recommend actually debugging why that \"no assets found\" is coming in the first place as how it's mentioned in the issue.\r\n\r\nYes, The issue is not occurring in other tabs; it is only happening on the Assets page. I have checked the code for the other tabs, and they have a similar implementation. However, in `AssetsList.tsx`, we are not using destructuring to assign `data `in `useQuery`. In contrast, in the other pages, `data ` is being destructured, and the loading logic is also implemented using `data?.count`.\r\n\r\nSo, I have updated the `AssetsList.tsx` loading logic to match the implementation of the other tabs.\r\n> \r\n> Using timer to solve this is more of a hack that hides the root cause of the issue and is not the right solution.\r\n> \r\nI have removed it\r\n> Ideally the `loading` state provided by the `useQuery` should be enough to show the Loading state and if not loading, `data.results.length` being 0 would convey if it's actually empty assets for the applied filters.\r\n\r\nOn page revisit, the data is initially undefined, which is why the issue is occurring. This condition was not properly handled \r\n along with the loading state in the if statement in `AssetsList.tsx`, like it was done in other tabs.\r\n\r\n"
