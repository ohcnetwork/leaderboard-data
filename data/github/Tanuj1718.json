I am working on it.\n> \n> date-field is expecting user to type in 2 digit values for month (handleMonthChange doesn't change anything if there's only one digit).\n> \n> To fix this, you can modify the logic in handleMonthChange to pad newMonth before the conditional checks. Also given that form doesn't allow submission when month > 12 (barring the padding issue above), I don't think any additional error handling is needed.\n> \n> Edit: handleMonthChange is also the reason why you are able to submit the form after going back and entering 122 in the month column (month isn't changed within form value, instead submitted with previous value).\n> \n> Edit: The auto focus to next cell causes an issue here, hmm let me see.\n\nI have also tried onFocus and onInput event handlers to clear the values but it is not working.\n"
