Review and update the mobile layout to ensure that the tabs adjust correctly on smaller screens. 2. Use responsive design techniques so that the content scales properly without causing overflow or readability issues. 3. Change the placeholder text for the input box: for the first tab, use \"Enter Aadhaar Number OR Virtual ID,\" and for the second tab, use \"Enter linked ID.\" 4. Consider adding tooltips to the tabs or input fields to offer additional guidance. 5. Test the updated design on various mobile devices and screen sizes to confirm that the changes resolve the issues and improve usability.**\n> \n> [@Tanuj1718](https://github.com/Tanuj1718) [@brainless](https://github.com/brainless) [@giju](https://github.com/giju) [@Ashesh3](https://github.com/Ashesh3) [@riginoommen](https://github.com/riginoommen)\n\n@aniket866 Issues can be assigned only by the maintainers, so please do not tag other people.
