Planning to do the same in location and organization forms.\n\n_2.The button should be disabled when user visits first time_\n\nCould see the button has a disabling logic already based on mutation and form state. I am thinking of adding another condition there to check the validity of form state.\n\n</p>\n</details> \n\n**Results:**\n\nWhen required field is empty\n\n<img width=\"1436\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2293ca4-2974-49d4-9c99-d07f11e41e5e\" />\n<img width=\"1437\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ed7cab9-2994-47c5-a120-c46a54ae202a\" />\n\nAnd when required field is filled\n\n<img width=\"796\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9d8bf4b-bf0e-4191-934a-e59b3641d3b7\" />"
