      "text": "I’ve already implemented the role-based filtering feature as described in the issue. The UI is clean, fully tested, and TypeScript-safe. Everything works without errors, and I’ve ensured it aligns with existing UI patterns.\n\nSince there’s no direct API for fetching roles, I’ve worked around it to ensure proper functionality. I’m currently finalizing API integrations where necessary.\n\nWould love to get this issue assigned so I can submit a PR. Let me know if any additional changes or validations are needed.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3cc63d1-d88d-487d-94a6-0ed48ad0a7e4"
